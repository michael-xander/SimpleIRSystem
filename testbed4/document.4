Geometric Programming: We are going to leave our discussion of OpenGL for a while, and discuss some of the
basic elements of geometry, which will be needed for the rest of the course. There are many areas of computer
science that involve computation with geometric entities. This includes not only computer graphics, but also
areas like computer-aided design, robotics, computer vision, and geographic information systems. In this and
the next few lectures we will consider how this can be done, and how to do this in a reasonably clean and painless
way.
Computer graphics deals largely with the geometry of lines and linear objects in 3-space, because light travels
in straight lines. For example, here are some typical geometric problems that arise in designing programs for
computer graphics.
Geometric Intersections: Given a cube and a ray, does the ray strike the cube? If so which face? If the ray is
reflected off of the face, what is the direction of the reflection ray?
Orientation: Three noncollinear points in 3-space define a unique plane. Given a fourth point q, is it above,
below, or on this plane?
Transformation: Given unit cube, what are the coordinates of its vertices after rotating it 30 degrees about the
vector (1; 2; 1).
Change of coordinates: A cube is represented relative to some standard coordinate system. What are its coordinates
relative to a different coordinate system (say, one centered at the camera’s location)?
Such basic geometric problems are fundamental to computer graphics, and over the next few lectures, our goal
will be to present the tools needed to answer these sorts of questions. (By the way, a good source of information
on how to solve these problems is the series of books entitled “Graphics Gems”. Each book is a collection of
many simple graphics problems and provides algorithms for solving them.)

Coordinate-free programming: If you look at almost any text on computer graphics (ours included) you will find
that the section on geometric computing begins by introducing coordinates, then vectors, then matrices. Then
what follows are many long formulas involving many 4_4 matrices. These formulas are handy, because (along
with some procedures for matrix multiplication) we can solve many problems in computer graphics. Unfortunately,
from the perspective of software design they are a nightmare, because the intention of the programmer
has been lost in all the “matrix crunching.” The product of a matrix and a vector can have many meanings. It
may represent a change of coordinate systems, it may represent a transformation of space, and it may represent
a perspective projection.
We will attempt to develop a clean, systematic way of thinking about geometric computations. This method
is called coordinate-free programming (so named by Tony DeRose, its developer). Rather than reducing all
computations to vector-matrix products, we will express geometric computations in the form of high-level geometric
operations. These in turn will be implemented using low-level matrix computations, but if you use a good
object-oriented programming language (such as C++ or Java) these details are hidden. Henceforth, when the
urge to write down an expression involving point coordinates comes to you, ask yourself whether it is possible
to describe this operation in a high-level coordinate-free form.
Ideally, this should be the job of a good graphics API. Indeed, OpenGL does provide the some support for
geometric operations. For example, it provides procedures for performing basic affine transformations. Unfortunately,
a user of OpenGL is still very aware of underlying presence of vectors and matrices in programming.
A really well designed API would allow us to conceptualize geometry on a higher level.
Geometries: Before beginning we should discuss a little history. Geometry is one of the oldest (if not the oldest)
branches of mathematics. Its origins were in land surveying (and hence its name: geo=earth, and metria=
measure). Surveying became an important problem as the advent of agriculture required some way of
defining the boundaries between one family’s plot and anothers.
Ancient civilizations (the Egyptians, for example) must have possessed a fairly sophisticated understanding of
geometry in order to build complex structures like the pyramids. However, it was not until much later in the
time of Euclid in Greece in the 3rd century BC, that the mathematical field of geometry was first axiomatized
and made formal. Euclid worked without the use of a coordinate system. It was much later in the 17th century
when cartesian coordinates were developed (by Descartes), which allowed geometric concepts to be expressed
arithmetically.
In the late 19th century a revolutionary shift occurred in people’s view of geometry (and mathematics in general).
Up to this time, no one questioned that there is but one geometry, namely the Euclidean geometry. Mathematicians
like Lobachevski and Gauss, suggested that there may be other geometric systems which are just as
consistent and valid as Euclidean geometry, but in which different axioms apply. These are called noneuclidean
geometries, and they played an important role in Einstein’s theory of relativity.
We will discuss three basic geometric systems: affine geometry, Euclidean geometry, and projective geometry.
Affine geometry is the most basic of these. Euclidean geometry builds on affine geometry by adding the concepts
of angles and distances. Projective geometry is more complex still, but it will be needed in performing
perspective projections.
Affine Geometry: The basic elements of affine geometry are scalars (which we can just think of as being real numbers),
points and free vectors (or simply vectors). Points are used to specify position. Free vectors are used to
specify direction and magnitude, but have no fixed position. The term “free” means that vectors do not necessarily
emanate from some position (like the origin), but float freely about in space. There is a special vector
called the zero vector, ~0, that has no magnitude, such that ~v +~0 = ~0 +~v = ~v. Note in particular that we did
not define a zero point or “origin” for affine space. (Although we will eventually have to break down and define
something like this in order, simply to be able to define coordinates for our points.)
You might ask, why make a distinction between points and vectors? Both can be represented in the same way
as a list of coordinates. The reason is to avoid hiding the intention of the programmer. For example, it makes
perfect sense to multiply a vector and a scalar (we stretch the vector by this amount). It is not so clear that it
Lecture Notes 27 CMSC 427
makes sense to multiply a point by a scalar. By keeping these concepts separate, we make it possible to check
the validity of geometric operations.
We will use the following notational conventions. Points will be denotes with upper-case Roman letters (e.g.,
P, Q, and R), vectors will be denoted with lower-case Roman letters (e.g., u, v, and w) and often to emphasize
this we will add an arrow (e.g., ~u, ~v, ~w), and scalars will be represented as lower case Greek letters (e.g., _, _,
). In our programs scalars will be translated to Roman (e.g., a, b, c).
The table below lists the valid combinations of these entities. The formal definitions are pretty much what you
would expect. Vector operations are applied in the same way that you learned in linear algebra. For example,
vectors are added in the usual “tail-to-head” manner. The difference P -Q of two points results in a free vector
directed from Q to P. Point-vector addition R +~v is defined to be the translation of R by displacement ~v. Note
that some operations (e.g. scalar-point multiplication, and addition of points) are explicitly not defined.

Affine Combinations: Although the algebra of affine geometry has been careful to disallow point addition and scalar
multiplication of points, there is a particular combination of two points that we will consider legal. The operation
is called an affine combination.
Let’s say that we have two points P and Q and want to compute their midpoint R, or more generally a point R
that subdivides the line segment PQ into the proportions _ and 1 - _, for some _ 2 [0; 1]. (The case _ = 1=2
is the case of the midpoint). This could be done by taking the vector Q-P, scaling it by _, and then adding the
result to P. That is,
