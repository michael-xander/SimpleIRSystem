Although a significant speedup was achieved compared to
the naïve approach, two major problems were not solved.
The first problem is that each occlusion query needs some
time, so if too many of them are wasted, the performance is
reduced compared to view frustum culling alone. The main
source of wasted queries is the fact that all visible leaf nodes
need to be queried to determine the visibility state of all
nodes in the hierarchy. In addition, many queries that are performed
for inner nodes which were frustum culled in the previous
frame are wasted as well. Assuming that these nodes
are visible is however even worse, since then all of their
leaves would be rendered with an additional query for each.
The second problem is that the performance gain of occlusions
is delayed by one frame, since previously visible leaf
nodes are directly rendered and the query results are only
used in the next frame. The first problem was already partially
addressed by Staneker et al. [SBS04] who proposed a
method to save queries for objects that are certainly visible.
A variety of software tests, like occupancy maps or software
occlusion tests with reduced resolution, are used to determine
if the object covers screen areas that are still empty.
However, when using current graphics hardware these relatively
costly software tests are unfortunately almost always
slower than the hardware occlusion query itself.
2.2. Graphics hardware parametrization
To achieve a given constant frame rate in scenes with highly
varying complexity, several methods to estimate the rendering
time have been proposed starting with the work of
Funkhouser and Séquin [FS93]. Considering the fact that
an upper bound of the rendering time is required for a constant
frame rate,Wimmer andWonka [WW03] modified this
method and also adapted it to the characteristics of current

graphics hardware. Although their method is very efficient
in achieving a constant frame rate, it cannot be used to guide
the decision of whether rendering with occlusion culling is
better than rendering without occlusion culling, as in this
case an approximate time is required rather than an upper
bound. In addition, neither of the above mentioned two algorithms
is able to give time estimations for hardware occlusion
queries which are different from those for the rendering
of the bounding box.
3. Analytical Models
To achieve a near optimal scheduling of occlusion queries,
both the outcome of each query and the times required for
rendering and for performing the query itself must be estimated.
This estimation is based on two analytical models
which we derive in the follo
