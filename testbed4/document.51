Starting with the parabola as I was talking about the focus was at F which is a, 0. So this distance is a. This is any point on the curve say P(x, y) it could be anywhere on the curve.
And the vertical dotted line is a directrix which is at x equals minus a. If you look back you remember the directrix is at minus a as given here for the case of a parabola. So if you look forward for the parabola the directrix is at minus a. And this is the origin O, this is a point M which is the perpendicular draft from the point P on the directrix line. On the directrix if you draw a perpendicular line from P that project the point P on the directrix you get the projection of P as M on the directrix line. So the eccentricity term which is defined as e is equal to 1 here, of course it is not very clear with respect to this figure I must admit here that most of these curves are not purely computer simulated.
Some of them will be computer simulated but I have tried to draw them by hand sketch so some of these are qualitatively looking very good but it may not be quantitatively accurate so I must inform you this. So, for a parabola the eccentricity is defined by the ratio of this distance that is between P to F and P to M. I repeat; from PF to PM that the ratio of the distance of a point on the curve to the focus divided by the distance of the point from the curve through the directrix. So the ratio of these two distances is the eccentricity e and since we are talking of a ratio and distance is always a positive value so the ratio also will be a positive number it will never be negative.
Of course it could be less then 1, it could be equal to 1, it could be more than 1 and based on these three conditions we have three different curves. As for example the case of a parabola these two distances are same and hence the eccentricity e is equal to 1. So e is equal to 1 in the case of a parabola we have seen, it is more than 1 in the case of a hyperbola, ellipse it is less then 1 but greater than 0 it is a fractional number. So remember these three ranges of the values of e. I hope you have noted down very carefully these three terms from the previous slide itself.
And remember, the eccentricity we have just defined now with this help of this figure. It is definitely going to be the same. It is the ratio of the distance of the point on the curve to the focus divided by the distance of the point from the directrix. That is the definition of eccentricity if the parabola here and this is the case for a hyperbola. And we have two directrix as given earlier at plus and minus a. Two of these vertical dashed or dotted lines at x equals a by e here and x equals minus a by e here is the origin and this the point P again on the curve on the hyperbola and you drop the perpendicular on to the M. So if you take a point P here on the negative x axis you can drop and you will get another point MPF. So this is the distance which is be more than 1 here there is P to F divided by P to M so that is the eccentricity here.
The focus is now ae because since e was equal to 1it was a, o, now it is ae, 0 and ae is more than 1 we know that so this is the case of a hyperbola. So this is how a hyperbola qualitatively will look at. I must again admit that this not a computer simulated one. But one can easily do that using any simulation tool box, you can use simulings or matlab tool box or any other thing to or any other plot command to generate points for a hyperbola, parabola or an ellipse and plot that. So qualitatively the curves will look like this. Let us look in to the last one which is for the case of an ellipse. It has two focus here
like the case of a hyperbola so it is at ae, 0 and minus ae, 0 so these are the two focus of the ellipse here and this is the point P(x, y) 0.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:24:27)
Remember, the definition of e terms that is the ratio here will be such that this intersection is at a, 0 here, for the ellipse it is 0, b at this point and a, 0 at this point and the ratio of distance will be less than 1 but more than 0. So this is the ratio of this by this distance P to F and P to M here among this point is M and P to F and P to M will be between 0 and 1 which is a fractional number. So this is the case of an ellipse. We will go back and compare this figure with the case of a parabola and hyperbola again. This is what you have for a parabola and hyperbola. Focus ae, 0 or a, 0 directrix plus and minus a by e the same concept hold goods here.
There are two directrix for an ellipse, the two focus ae, 0. Parabola of course you have only one directrix and one focal point and the eccentricity is defined by the ratio of these two distances of a point from the curve to the focus and projection of the point on the directrix. This is what we have as the three special curves under the category of conic section. In the three special classes of curves as parabola, hyperbola and ellipse the difference is mainly in the eccentricity which distinguishes them as termed here. But of course we have seen in the previous slides also that the expressions do vary in terms of the Cartesian coordinate form or the parametric form of the expressions of an ellipse hyperbola or parabola.
So let us look back into the slide to compare the three different and special classes of conic the parabola, ellipse and hyperbola once again. And we will look back into this slide to find out the difference in both the Cartesian coordinate form then the focus which is ae, 0 where e is equal to 1 in the case of a parabola, e is greater than 1 in the hyperbola and e is between 0 to 1and it is a fraction in the case of an ellipse. The directrix is at ae,
