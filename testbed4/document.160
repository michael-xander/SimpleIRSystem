In this section, we turn to the question of lighting and material in WebGL. We will continue to use the basic OpenGL model that was covered in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2, but now we are responsible for implementing the lighting equation in our own GLSL shader programs. That means being more aware of the implementation details. It also means that we can pick and choose which parts of the lighting equation we will implement for a given application.
The goal of the lighting equation is to compute a color for a point on a surface. The inputs to the equation include the materialproperties of the surface and the properties of light sources that illuminate the surface. The angle at which the light hits the surface plays an important role. The angle can be computed from the direction to the light source and the normal vector to the surface. Computation of specular reflection also uses the direction to the viewer and the direction of the reflected ray. The four vectors that are used in the computation are shown in this lighting diagram from Subsection 4.1.4:
 
The vectors L, N, R, and V should be unit vectors. Recall that unit vectors have the property that the cosine of the angle between two unit vectors is given by the dot product of the two vectors.
The lighting equation also involves ambient and emission color, which do not depend the direction vectors shown in the diagram.
You should keep this big picture in mind as we work through some examples that use various aspects of the lighting model.
