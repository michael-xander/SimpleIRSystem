Ray tracing is among the conceptually simplest methods for synthesizing highly realistic images. Unlike
the simple polygon rendering methods used by OpenGL, ray tracing can easily produce shadows, and it can
model reflective and transparent objects. Because it is slow, ray tracing is typically used for generating highly
realistic images offline (as opposed to interactively), but it is useful for generating realistic texture maps and
environment maps that could later be used in interactive rendering. Ray tracing also forms the basis of many
approaches to more producing highly realistic complex types of shading and lighting. In spite of its conceptual
simplicity, ray tracing can be computationally quite intensive. Today we will discuss the basic elements of ray
tracing, and next time we will discuss the details of handling ray intersections in greater detail.
The Basic Idea: Consider our standard perspective viewing scenario. There is a viewer located at some position, and
in front of the viewer is the view plane, and on this view plane is a window. We want to render the scene that is
visible to the viewer through this window. Consider an arbitrary point on this window. The color of this point is
determined by the light ray that passes through this point and hits the viewer’s eye.
More generally, light travels in rays that are emitted from the light source, and hit objects in the environment.
When light hits a surface, some of its energy is absorbed, and some is reflected in different directions. (If the
object is transparent, light may also be transmitted through the object.) The light may continue to be reflected
off of other objects. Eventually some of these reflected rays find their way to the viewer’s eye, and only these
are relevant to the viewing process.
If we could accurately model the movement of all light in a 3-dimensional scene then in theory we could produce
very accurate renderings. Unfortunately the computational effort needed for such a complex simulation would
be prohibitively large. How might we speed the process up? Observe that most of the light rays that are emitted
from the light sources never even hit our eye. Consequently the vast majority of the light simulation effort is
wasted. This suggests that rather than tracing light rays as they leave the light source (in the hope that it will
eventually hit the eye), instead we reverse things and trace backwards along the light rays that hit the eye. This
is the idea upon which ray tracing is based.
Ray Tracing Model: Imagine that the viewing window is replaced with a fine mesh of horizontal and vertical grid
lines, so that each grid square corresponds to a pixel in the final image. We shoot rays out from the eye through
the center of each grid square in an attempt to trace the path of light backwards toward the light sources.
Consider the first object that such a ray hits. (In order to avoid problems with jagged lines, called aliasing, it
is more common to shoot a number of rays per pixel and average their results.) We want to know the intensity
of reflected light at this surface point. This depends on a number of things, principally the reflective and color
properties of the surface, and the amount of light reaching this point from the various light sources. The amount
of light reaching this surface point is the hard to compute accurately. This is because light from the various light
sources might be blocked by other objects in the environment and it may be reflected off of others.
A purely local approach to this question would be to use the model we discussed in the Phong model, namely
that a point is illuminated if the angle between the normal vector and light vector is acute. In ray tracing it is

common to use a somewhat more global approximation. We will assume that the light sources are points. We
shoot a ray from the surface point to each of the light sources. For each of these rays that succeeds in reaching
a light source before being blocked another object, we infer that this point is illuminated by this source, and
otherwise we assume that it is not illuminated, and hence we are in the shadow of the blocking object. (Can you
