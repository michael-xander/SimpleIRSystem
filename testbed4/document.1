In 2D we specify a window on 2D world and a view port on 2D view surface
objects in world are clipped against window and are then transformed into view port for display.
Added complexity caused by
i. added dimension
ii. display devise are only 2D
Solution is accomplished by introducing projections that transform 3D objects onto 2D plane
In 3D we specify view volume(only those objects within view volume will appear in display on output device
others are clipped from display) in world , projection onto projection plane and view port on view surface
So objects in 3D world are clipped against 3D view volume and are then projected
the contents of projection of view volume onto projection plane called window are then transformed
(mapped onto ) view port for display.
Projections
Transform points in coordinate system of dimension ‘n’ into points in a coordinate system of dimension less
than ‘n’.
Projection of 3D object is defined by straight projection rays(projectors) emanating from center of
projection, passing thru each point of object and intersecting a projection plane to form projection.
These are planar geometric projection as the projection is onto a plane rather than some curved surface and
uses straight rather than curved projectors.
2 types of projections
i. distinction is in relation of center of projection to projection plane
ii. if the distance from one to other
is finite then projection is perspective
iii. if the distance is infinite then projection is parallel.
Perspective
A perspective projection whose center is
a point at infinity becomes a parallel projection
Visual effect of perspective projection is similar to that of photographic system and human visual system.
Size of perspective projection of an object varies inversely with distance of that object from the center of
projection
Although objects tend to look realistic, is not particularly useful for recording exact shape and measurements
of objects.
Perspective projection of any set of parallel lines that are not parallel to projection plane converge to
vanishing point
In 3D parallel lines meet only at infinity
If the set of lines parallel to one of three principal axes then vanishing point is called axis vanishing point
eg. If projection plane cuts only z axis and normal to it , only z axis has principle vanishing point as lines
parallel to either y or x axes are also parallel to projection plane and has no vanishing points
In fig lines parallel to x,y do not converge only lines parallel to z axis converge
Parallel
Coordinate positions are transformed to the view plane along parallel lines
Preserves relative proportions of objects so that accurate views of various sides of an object are obtained but
doesn’t give realistic representation of the 3D object.
Can be used for exact measurements so parallel lines remain parallel.
