What are those five boundary conditions? Please try to recollect, the two end points, coordinates of these two end points x1y1 x2y2 in 2D you can visualize this curve in 3D also. x1y1z1 to x2y2z2 the curve could be in 3D that is also possible. So we know those two coordinates of the two end points or the starting point and the finishing point of the
c
We know the slope of the tangent as to that is how the curve will start and finish. The slope of the derivative say the curve is coming out like this so that is a tangent to the curve and the way it finishes at the end point. So we can also define this, we will come up with that figure illustrating the slope or the derivative or the tangent to that curve at the end point and finishing point. So two end point coordinates and two of the derivatives at the slope and end point so four of them and fifth point is obtained by an intermediate point in between because we not only should know where it starts and where it finishes but we should also know some point in between where it is going to traverse. So, if you change anyone of these five geometric conditions either the starting point or the finishing point or anyone of these two tangents at the start and the f

The nature by which the curve appears or looks like will change and in mathematical terms the coefficients will vary. The coefficients which define this curve in terms of this five or six also will vary. Look back into the slide; this is the general way by which these coefficients are obtained. So there are six from this we reduce to five by allowing the origin to be at the conic or the conic to be at the origin or assuming one of the parameters to be a constant and we are left over or we have five of these coefficients which may be obtained using five of these geometric conditions, two slope of the curves at the end points or the tangen
in I hope this is clear and when we look forward we will see special forms of these conics also. We also have to find when these a b c d e f results in these three different special types of conic sections like the ellipse, parabola, hyperbola etc. And of course when you know an ellipse you can also say circle under that category. Generalize conic; if you look back that is the

So we will discuss about that right now. We will re-organize these expressions of the generalized conic in a matrix form in this nature. We will re-organize this expression in the form XS, X transpose is e

Since it is a 2D x y one vector so X is nothing but a homogeneous representation of a point in 2D that is X here and the S is a symmetric matrix with the coefficients a b c d f obtained from this quadric expression here and is plugged into this matrix 3 into 3. So you can see here, I leave this as an exercise for you to visualize that if you break open this expression you will get this quadratic form. You can almost visu
mYou can take this as a home exercise or you can solve this one as the lecture proceeds to visualize how these matrix form of the expression could be either derived from the

Now if you carefully look back the S matrix which is given here is a symmetric matrix. There are two of these terms b d and e, I repeat two bs, two of these ds and two of these es and this has to be there because S is a symmetric matrix a c f are the diagonal terms. So the non-diagonal terms or the off-diagonal terms in this symmetric matrix must duplicate itself to give the symmetric nature of the matrix. And if that is so you require two of these off-diagonal terms which are b d and e and hence that is the reason why we use that factor two in that quadratic form. That is the answer to my

You may not use two. Nobody forces you to use two but if you do not use two you can still write the expression second degree
