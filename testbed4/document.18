We begin discussion of 3-dimensional object models. There is an important fundamental
split in the question of how objects are to be represented. Two common choices are between representing
the 2-dimensional boundary of the object, called a boundary representation or B-rep for short, and a
volume-based representation, which is sometimes called CSG for constructive solid geometry. Both have their
advantages and disadvantages.
Volume Based Representations: One of the most popular volume-based representations is constructive solid geometry,
or CSG for short. It is widely used in manufacturing applications. One of the most intuitive ways to describe
complex objects, especially those arising in manufacturing applications, is as set of boolean operations (that
is, set union, intersection, difference) applied to a basic set of primitive objects. Manufacturing is an important
application of computer graphics, and manufactured parts made by various milling and drilling operations can
be described most naturally in this way. For example, consider the object shown in the figure below. It can be
described as a rectangular block, minus the central rectangular notch, minus two cylindrical holes, and union
with the rectangular block on the upper right side.

This idea naturally leads to a tree representation of the object, where the leaves of the tree are certain primitive
object types (rectangular blocks, cylinders, cones, spheres, etc.) and the internal nodes of the tree are boolean
operations, union (X [ Y ), intersection (X \ Y ), difference (X -Y ), etc. For example, the object above might
be described with a tree of the following sort. (In the figure we have used + for union.)
Fig. 65: CSG Tree.
The primitive objects stored in the leaf nodes are represented in terms of a primitive object type (block, cylinder,
sphere, etc.) and a set of defining parameters (location, orientation, lengths, radii, etc.) to define the location
and shape of the primitive. The nodes of the tree are also labeled by transformation matrices, indicating the
transformation to be applied to the object prior to applying the operation. By storing both the transformation
and its inverse, as we traverse the tree we can convert coordinates from the world coordinates (at the root of the
tree) to the appropriate local coordinate systems in each of the subtrees.
This method is called constructive solid geometry (CSG) and the tree representation is called a CSG tree. One
nice aspect to CSG and this hierarchical representation is that once a complex part has been designed it can
be reused by replicating the tree representing that object. (Or if we share subtrees we get a representation as a
directed acyclic graph or DAG.)
Point membership: CSG trees are examples of unevaluated models. For example, unlike a B-rep representation in
which each individual element of the representation describes a feature that we know is a part of the object,
it is generally impossible to infer from any one part of the CSG tree whether a point is inside, outside, or on
the boundary of the object. As a ridiculous example, consider a CSG tree of a thousand nodes, whose root
operation is the subtraction of a box large enough to enclose the entire object. The resulting object is the empty
set! However, you could not infer this fact from any local information in the data structure.
Consider the simple membership question: Given a point P does P lie inside, outside, or on the boundary of an
object described by a CSG tree. How would you write an algorithm to solve this problem? For simplicity, let
us assume that we will ignore the case when the point lies on the boundary (although we will see that this is a
tricky issue below).
The idea is to design the program recursively, solving the problem on the subtrees first, and then combining
results from the subtrees to determine the result at the parent. We will write a procedure isMember(Point P,
CSGnode T) where P is the point, and T is pointer to a node in the CSG tree. This procedure returns True if the
object defined by the subtree rooted at T contains P and False otherwise. If T is an internal node, let T:left and
T:right denote the children of T. The algorithm breaks down into the following cases.
Note that the semantics of operations “jj” and “&&” avoid making recursive calls when they are not needed. For
example, in the case of union, if P lies in the right subtree, then the left subtree need not be searched.
CSG and Ray Tracing: CSG objects can be handled very naturally in ray tracing. Suppose that R is a ray, and T is
a CSG tree. The intersection of the ray with any CSG object can be described as a (possibly empty) sorted set
of intervals in the parameter space.
I = h[t0; t1]; [t2; t3]; : : :i:
(See Fig. 66.) This means that we intersect the object whenever t0 _ t _ t1 and t2 _ t _ t3, and so on. At the
leaf level, the set of intervals is either empty (if the ray misses the object) or is a single interval (if it hits). Now,

we evaluate the CSG tree through a post-order traversal, working from the leaves up to the root. Suppose that
we are at a union node v and we have the results from the left child IL and the right child IR.
We compute the union of these two sets of intervals. This is done by first sorting the endpoints of the intervals.
With each interval endpoint we indicate whether this is an entry or exit. Then we traverse this sorted list. We
maintain a depth counter, which is initialized to zero, and is incremented whenever we enter an interval and
decremented when we exit an interval. Whenever this count transitions from 0 to 1, we output the endpoint as
the start of a new interval in the union, and whenever the depth count transitio
