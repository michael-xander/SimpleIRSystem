The authors have developed a modeling system Do in three dimensional
computer graphics (3D-CG) that, by verbal instructions in
natural language, models geometrical shapes and renders the images.
The former system is based on a step-by-step construction
scheme using static instructions and a static display, that is, a static
verbal instruction creates a static scene and an image. This staticbased
system scheme has a critical limitation at the conversation
stage between a user and the system. In this paper, the authors propose
a dynamic instruction and dynamic display methods for the
modeling system. First, the dynamic display enables users to watch
the animation indicating the change between the previous geometries
and the next geometries with smooth transition during the execution
of an instruction from the user. Second, the dynamic instruction
enables users to give the next instruction before the animation
ends. For those purposes, two geometrical transformation methods
by affine transformation: (a) with a common difference matrix,
and (b) with a common ratio matrix, are introduced and studied
to generate frames for the animation. The proposed methods are
implemented and evaluated by some experiments. The changes between
instructions are observed naturally by the common ratio matrix
method.
In contrast to it, the system Do requires only verbal
instructions for input to realize the purposes mentioned above.
Picnyck[H. Nishiyama and Matsusita 1997] creates an appropriate
scenery image for a scenery description text including vague expressions
such as ‘vast’, ‘pure’, etc. At the present phase, system
Do does not support sensitive words yet, however, it is effective
to introduce some operations, for example, changing the texture of
the object. A system Put[Clay and Wilhelms 1996] refers to the
position of existing objects and puts an object using the position
information. Our system Do introduces a disposition function of
objects similar to the system Put and has a lot of operations including
translation, scaling, rotation, CSG operations, etc. by not
only instructions with a single word but also sentences in natural
language.
However, a user is required to indicate clearly the state of the imagined
scene statically by an instruction sentence in step-by-step operations
in the former instruction method, called a static instruction
method. Users of the system based on this instruction method
watch a static scene, called a static display method. Increase of the
number of conversations by this method becomes problematic. This
static instruction and static display method have a critical limitation
at conversations between a user and the system. In this paper, the
authors propose the dynamic instruction and the dynamic display
method for the modeling system by such a verbal interface. There
are two important ideas in this study. One is that the dynamic display
enables users to watch the animation indicating the change between
previous and next geometries with a smooth transition. The
other is that the dynamic instruction enables users to issue the next
instruction before the animation ends.
For an instruction from the user, the dynamic display method provides
an animation indicating the change of the state of the object
continuously. The dynamic instruction method enables the user to
change the transformation and/or to add another transformation to
a current transformation instructed previously while the object is
changing. This system utilizes affine transformations to change
states of objects. To realize the above functions, two basic strategies
to transform the objects: (a) a common difference matrix, and
(b) a common ratio matrix, are studied for an affine matrix. Some
experiments by the matrices indicate that the common ratio matrix
method provides better impressions. For related works of the
dynamic display method [S. Miyazaki and Yasuda 2003] proposed
a method converting scenarios of natural texts into multiple basic
motions of a CG character and synthesizing various motions with
emotions by synchronization. In this method, the target of the dynamic
instruction is a motion with emotions of the CG character
and the effectiveness of the dynamic instruction method is shown.
