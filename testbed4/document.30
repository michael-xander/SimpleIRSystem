Visibility using the Z-Buffer can be very inefficient.
_ Example: Consider rendering a sequence of spheres
_ All spheres are rendered, but only the closest is visible!
_ Depth Complexity: the number of times a pixel is overwritten
_ Real-life examples: rain forest, city models, interior of skyscraper,
engine block

Occlusion Culling(OC)
_ Algorithmic approaches to avoid drawing related inefficiencies.
_ Optimally, only visible objects are drawn.
_ Occlusion culling algorithms perform simple tests early on to avoid
sending objects down the graphics pipeline.
_ Types of occlusion culling: point-based, cell-based
_ Point-Based OC: visibility from a single viewing location.
_ Cell-Based OC: visibility from a region of space
_ OC based on image(2D), object(3D) or ray space.
_ Cell based OC is more expensive to compute, but valid for a few
Frames
Occluded objects are not processed.
_ Potentially visible objects: Has to be rendered, added to P, might
undergo merging (fusion), based on occluding power of the set.
_ Want to fuse objects that can form the best occluders for incoming
objects.
_ Some algorithms cannot merge occluders, some update OR only
once per frame
_ Object ordering matters, rough front to back sorting performed by
some algorithms.
_ Object distance matters; matchbox can occlude Golden Gate
Bridge!

Occlusion Horizons (Wonka,Schmalstieg 1999,
Downs 2001
_ Targeted at rendering urban environments.
_ Objects composed of buildings and ground (2.5D) treated as a
height field
_ Occlusion horizon is constructed on the fly and used to cull incoming
objects (roughly front to back order)
_ Point Based occlusion culling

Occlusion Horizons Method
_ Quadtree of the XY plane of the scene is built
_ Sweep a plan parallel to near-plane from the viewer, front to back.
_ Objects to be culled are overestimated with a bounding volume, occluders
are underestimated with Convex Vertical Prisms (CVP)
_ Union of CVPs and ground mesh forms a height field, and a conservative
estimate of occluding power.
_ Horizon representation: piecewise constant function of
