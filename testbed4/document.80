The rich theory of B-splines can be used to develop expressions for the entries of the re?nement matrix Pj (see Chui and Quak [4] or Quak and Weyrich [13] for details). The columns ofPj are sparse, re?ecting the fact that the B-spline basis functions are locally supported. The ?rst and last d columns of Pj are relatively complicated, but the remaining (interior) columns are shifted versions of column d + 1. Moreover, the entries of these interior columns are, up to a common factor of 1

2d, given by binomial coef?cients.

3.3 B-spline wavelets
Tocomplete our development of a multiresolution analysis based on B-splines, we need to ?nd basis functions for the spacesWj that are orthogonal complements to the spacesVj. As shown in Section 2.1, the wavelets are determined by matricesQj satisfying Equation (5), which we repeat here for convenience:
[
h 

j 

]Qj = 0. (11)
Since this is a homogeneous system of linear equations, there is not a unique solution. We must therefore impose additional conditions. To get wavelets with small supports, for example, we require each column of Qj to have a minimal number of consecutive nonzeros. This constraint imposes a banded structure onQj similar to that of Pj. For each column q of Qj, Equation (11) leads to a small homogeneous system that we solve for the non-zero entries in q. Thematrices thatresult and the corresponding B-spline wavelets are shown in Appendix A
Finkelstein and Salesin [8] took this approach to construct cubic Bspline wavelets. Chui and Quak [4] derived slightly different spline wavelets using derivative and interpolation properties of B-splines. Note that both approaches result in semi-orthogonal wavelet bases: The wavelets are orthogonal to scaling functions at the same level, but not to each other, except in the piecewise-constant case.
3.4 B-spline ?lter bank
At this point, we have completed the steps in designing a multiresolution analysis. However, to use spline wavelets, we must implement a ?lter bank procedure incorporating the analysis ?ltersAj and Bj. These matrices allow us to determineCj

1 from Cj using matrix multiplication as in Equations (6) and (7). As discussed earlier in Section 2, the analysis ?lters are uniquely determined by the inverse relation in Equation (10):

However, as Quak and Weyrich [13] point out, when implementing the ?lter bank procedure for spline wavelets, it is generally not a good idea to form the ?ltersAj and Bj explicitly. AlthoughPj and Qj aresparse, having onlyO(d)entries percolumn,Aj andBj areingeneral dense, so matrix-vector multiplication would require quadratic instead of linear time. Fortunately, there is a better approach. The idea is to computeCj

solved in linear time using LU decomposition [12]. Thus we can compute the entire ?lter bank operation without ever forming and using Aj or Bj explicitly.
4 Application III: Multiresolution curves and surfaces
Wepresented twoapplications of waveletsin Part1: compression of one-dimensional signals and compression of two-dimensional images. Our third application of wavelets in computer graphics is curve design and editing, as described in detail by Finkelstein and Salesin [8]. Their multiresolution curves are built from a wavelet basis for endpoint-interpolating cubic B-splines, which we discussed in the previous section.
Multiresolution curves conveniently support a variety of operations:

changing a curve's overall "sweep" while maintaining its ?ne details, or "character" (Figures 3 and 4);

changing a curve's "character" without affecting its overall "sweep" (Figure 5);

editing a curve at any continuous level of detail, allowing an arbitrary portion of the curve to be affected through direct manipulation;

smoothing at continuous levels to remove undesirable features from a curve;

approximating or "?tting" a curve within a guaranteed maximum error tolerance, for scan conversion and other applications.
Here we'll describe brie?y just the ?rst two of these operations, which fall out quite naturally from the multiresolution representation.
4.1 Editing the sweep of the curve
Editing the sweep of a curve at an integer level of the wavelet transform is simple. Let CJ be the control points of the original curve fJ(t), let Cj be a low-resolution version of CJ, and let ˆ C j be an edited version of Cj, given by ˆ C j = Cj +

Cj.
Note that editing the sweep of the curve at lower levels of smoothing j affects larger portions of the high-resolution curvefJ(t). At the lowest level, when j = 0, the entire curve is affected. At the highest level, whenj = J, only thenarrow portion in?uenced by one original control point is affected. The kind of ?exibility that this multiresolution editing allows is suggested in Figures 3 and 4.
4.2 Editing the character of the curve
Multiresolution curves also naturally support changes in the character of a curve, without affecting its overall sweep. LetCJ be the control points of a curve, and letC0, D0,

, and reconstructing. To avoid coordinatesystem artifacts, all detail coef?cients are expressed in terms of the curve's local tangent and normal, rather than thex and y directions.
Figure 5 demonstrates how the character of curves in an illustration can be modi?ed with various detail styles. (The interactive illustration system used to create this ?gure was described by Salisbury et al. [14].)
4.3 Multiresolution surfaces
Multiresolution editing can be extended to surfaces by using tensor products of B-spline scaling functions and wavelets. Either the standard construction or the nonstandard construction described in Part 1 for Haar basis functions can be used to form a twodimensional basis from a one-dimensional B-spline basis. We can then edit surfaces using the same operations described for curves. For example, Figure 6 shows a bicubic tensor-product B-spline surface after altering its sweep at different levels of detail.
We can further generalize multiresolution analysis to surfaces of arbitrary topology by de?ning wavelets based on subdivision surfaces, as described by Lounsbery et al. [10]. Their nonorthogonal wavelet basis, in combination with the work of Eck et al. [6], allows any polyhedral object to be decomposed into scaling function and wavelet coef?cients. Then a compression scheme similar to the one presented for images in Section 3.3 of Part 1 can be used to display the object atvarious levels of detail simply by leaving out small wavelet coef?cients during reconstruction. An example of this technique is shown in Figure 7.
