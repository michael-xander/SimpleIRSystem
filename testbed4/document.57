Welcome back to the lectures on computer graphics. We are in the very last phase of the lecture series. So far we have discussed various aspects of computer graphics starting from devices to transformations to clipping, line drawing, rendering, hidden surface removal and in the last class we have seen a few special miscellaneous topics dealing with aliasing, animation, soft object modeling and so on and so forth. No computer graphics application or tool is complete without handling pictures or digital images. Digital images or digital image processing is a subject by itself that forms in most graphical applications or tools an important part of the applications.
So one of the applications of computer graphics is also digital image processing where you should know how digital image pictures are stored, retrieved, how they are manipulated if necessary. And as I was saying you have to go through a very exhaustive full-fledged course on digital image processing. But from the point of view of computer graphics I will give brief highlights of a few aspects of digital image processing which is necessary from the computer graphics angle.
You will need to store pictures in certain formats, you need to retrieve them as well and well you also need to manipulate them, you need to alter certain pictures, of course you know to probably rotate pictures in 2D but we will talk about scenarios where the image is of degraded quality and you will see how in the time to come how to enhance the pictures, how to remove noise from the pictures. The image could be noisy due to various effects due to sampling itself or due to the electronic circuitries which create noise in the picture. There could be noise coming out when the image is transmitted over the net.
So we will see topics about image enhancement also. But first come first serve, we will see how the digital image is stored in a computer. Of course there are various formats, various file formats based on which a digital image is stored. And we will probably be able to discuss only one of them in some detail and I will probably name a few other formats which do exist.
Of course there are numerous proprietary digital image formats based on which the picture or a digital image is stored in a computer. But we will talk about a compression standard which is very commonly used in different websites, web pages, sites which hosts digital image galleries, it will typically store image in a certain formats which is easy to transmit without much of loss of information.
Without much of degradation and quality you need to store a picture in as small amount of spaces possible not only to save storage space but also you should need less time to transmit over the internet. These days we have websites which not only hosts different type of graphical pages and contents but also pictures and movies of course. But if you take just pictures by itself there are whole lot of image galleries and other websites which store pictures which you can retrieve. But when you need to retrieve the picture the contents of the graphics page takes a long time when you need to download a digital picture. If it is very large in size the amount of time required to transmit it over the net could be very large. So you need to compress it and store it.
So we will talk about the digital image compression format called the JPEG and these are the two aspects which we will discuss today about digital image processing. One is about compression and the second part will be on image enhancement which we heard, we talked about trying to remove the noise in the picture and improve the quality of a picture. So before going into JPEG let us also look at the different digital image file formats. I was just mentioning a little while earlier that there are various types of file formats which are used to store digital pictures.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:43)
So just to name a few of the most commonly used or a popular image file formats which are used by most graphical systems or even image processing toolkits or webs, web pages or web sites which host pictures are the following. Let us see a few of them. We see here a list of few commonly used and popular digital image file formats.
Well, the first of this is the JPEG format which we will discuss in detail today. It is developed by the joint photographic experts group. The society of that developed this digital image file format which will be based on discrete cosine transform which we will discuss in detail later on. Then of course the same group came up with a JPEG 2000 which is based on discrete wavelength transform.
Among the other popular file formats are the BMP which is know as the Bitmap file format. Then we have the TIFF, TIFF which is when you expand you will see that it is Tagged Image File Format. That is a very common format used for scanning documents the TIFF or the tagged image file format. Then you have a class of digital file formats called the PGM, PBM and PPM together. Almost quite a few things are common in terms of the file headers here.
The PGM is called the Portable Grey Map. PGM is Portable Grey Map and PBM is Portable Bitmap. I repeat Portable Bitmap is PBM and PPM is Portable Pixel Map. So these fall under one class of portable map file formats grey bit and the pixel respectively.
Then at the bottom left of your screen you have the GIF which is the Graphic Interchange Format, I repeat Graphic Interchange Format. You also have the RAS which is the sun raster file format typically used for storing pictures in sun OS systems. It is called the sun raster image file format. Then you have the RAW file format which could be used in any system. In fact it is a file of the digital image which does not contain any overhead in terms of the pixel resolution, the number of bytes per pixel and the format etc.
The RAW will not contain any information about the format of the file as it is format free. Typically you may have one byte per pixel for monochrome or three bytes per pixel for color. Then of course you again have the SGI. The SGI format for storing graphic images in SGI which its in SGI silicon graphics proprietary format like we had the RAWs which was some raster preparatory format.
SGI is the SGI proprietary format. Then you have here XBM. Well XBM is a monochrome bitmap format in which the data is stored in c language data array. So monochrome bitmap is almost similar like a RAW where the data is stored as c language data array.
The CDR is again a proprietary format of coral draw. When you use the coral draw software for drawing images and pictures you basically save it in coral draw format basically in vectored format for storing pictures, drawings whatever you have. Then the last of this which you see on the right bottom of your screen is the PNG format or the Portable Network Graphics format. PNG is Portable Network Graphics format. These are a few examples of the commonly used popular digital file formats.
So let us go back and look at JPEG compression which we will discuss. We will discuss about the JPEG file format which is used because that is probably one of the most commonly used. And why it is probably most commonly used is that it can store pictures in a compressed format and when you have a huge database of image galleries to store this space becomes a criteria for you to store a large database of image galleries.
Then a compression standard using a mechanism to compress the image data and store it will be very useful and handy because you will require less space to store each image file.
And you can store more images or more image files within a certain disc space, limited amount of disc space although whatever large it may be.
