Time antialiasing, a.k.a. motion blur
106
We already mentioned the time aliasing effect. The most popular method of performing time antialiasing is still to generate several frames at very close interval and merge them together. Once more, different filters can be applied.
One has to be careful when performing motion blur. Visible motion blur is something that should only happen when things are moving faster than the frame rate allows us to see. For example, an animation going at 24 fps (frames per seconds) should not have a trail behind an object moving one millimeter per frame on the screen. Put in different terms, an animation going at 24 fps should not show in a frame an event that happened 0.25 seconds ago. This effect, called persistence, can be quite annoying, and though it can produce an interesting result, it is generally not interesting or realistic to do so.
Therefore, if we want to generate a time antialiased animation at 24 fps, we really need to generate something like an 120 fps animation, and then apply a filter to merge the frames four by four and get a 24 fps animation. This is, as can be seen, quite expensive. However, it tends to produce very nice looking pictures. If the frame rate isn't kicked high enough, a fast moving object will appear (in our example above) as 4 distinct though semitransparent images per frame. This is probably undesirable, but little can be done if objects are moving fast enough.
Other approaches have been attempted, mostly in raytracing, and will not be discussed here. One notable area that might be worth further interest is the extruding of polygons as volumes in 4d with time as the fourth dimension and trying to get the motion blur from that. This would have the advantage of being much more exact than anything presented here, all the while not having problems with very fast moving objects. However, even if the exact path of the object is known, extrusion along that path might be too expensive or difficult to perform, so linear extrusion might have to be considered. Nevertheless, I suspect this would produce very attractive results.
Mipmapping
107
Texture mapping was described previously. However, a naive approach was taken; we did not consider what happens when the texture is so scaled down that it takes several texels to cover a single pixel. In the context of this chapter, however, we would like to somehow "average" (more properly, filter) the texels that cover a single pixel to get a nicer looking picture. To illustrate the problem, if the texture is so shrunk that it barely covers one pixel, then the color of that pixel will be a more or less random point from the texture. Hence, if the texture is not very "smooth", this particular pixel can "blip", change color rapidly and scintillate. This is of course undesirable. Also, even though the texture seen from afar might be blue for the most part, a small reddish region might result in the whole pixel appearing red, which would be wrong.
Performing different approaches can be taken to this antialiasing problem. We can actually compute all the texels that fall within a pixel, then apply some filter, perhaps even based on the size of the texel in the pixel. These sort of approaches lend themselves very poorly to real-time applications, which is the main interest of this document, hence we will not approach them.
A real-time alternative is Mipmapping. The texture map is pre-filtered to different degrees, and at run time, we determine how much the texels get squished by the perspective transform, and the select the proper mipmap.
Uniform Mipmapping
Classically, this is how mipmapping is done. We start with a texture map. Say the texture map is of size 64x64. Then, mipmaps of size 32x32, 16x16, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1 are generated by recursively averaging 2x2 blocks of pixels. We start with the 64x64 texture map, then average each 2x2 block to get a 32x32 mipmap. Then we filter that mipmap again to get a 16x16 mipmap, and so on. The mipmaps can be labelled "mipmap #1" for the unfiltered texture map, "mipmap #2" for the first mipmap, and so on.
The mipmap should be chosen based on the amount of squishing we think the texels will undergo. If we feel that each pixel will cover about 4 texels (roughly a 2x2 block), then we should use the 32x32 mipmap. If the texmap is even more squished (perhaps 16 texels per pixel, 4x4) then the 16x16 mipmap should be used.
Let's look at memory requirements. Let K be the amount of memory used by the basic texture map. First we observe that averaging 2x2 block of pixels and making the first mipmap makes something which takes one fourth as much memory as the texture map. As a matter of fact, each time we generate another mipmap, the memory taken by the new mipmap is 1/4 that of the old. Hence the total memory is:
K+K/4+K/16+K/64+K/256+...+K/(4n)<K+K/4+K/16+...+K/(4n)+...
108
=K(1+1/4+1/16+1/64+........)=4K/3
Hence, classical mipmapping takes but 1/3 more memory than straight texture mapping.
The problem of determining which mipmap to use is, however, not trivial. As mentioned previously, this should be a function of the "squishing" undergone by the texels. However, the squishing in the x direction can be vastly different from the squishing in the y direction. You can fight with this, or you can invent a newer type of mipmapping.
Nonuniform Mipmapping
Instead of scaling the texture map homogeneously (by the same factor in x and y), we can generate mipmaps with nonuniform scaling. This way, if there is a lot of "squishing" in a direction, but very little in the other, a relatively good mipmap can still be found.
Still using the 64x64 example above, we would generate mipmaps of the following sizes:
64x64 64x32 64x16 64x8 64x4 64x2 64x1
32x64 32x32 32x16 32x8 32x4 32x2 32x1
16x64 16x32 16x16 16x8 16x4 16x2 16x1
8x64 8x32 8x16 8x8 8x4 8x2 8x1
4x64 4x32 4x16 4x8 4x4 4x2 4x1
2x64 2x32 2x16 2x8 2x4 2x2 2x1
1x64 1x32 1x16 1x8 1x4 1x2 1x1
Note that the mipmaps can be indexed by a pair of number. For instance, the mipmap 64x64 can be identified to the pair (1,1), the mipmap 64x16 could be identified to the point (3,1), mipma 2x4 would be (5,6) and mipmap 1x1 would be (7,7).
It might appear on first look that this will require a lot of memory, however this is not as bad as it might first appears. A geometric demonstration is given below. This figure contains the texture map plus all the mipmaps listed above. As can be seen, the memory taken by the mipmaps and the texture map is four times the memory taken by the texture map alone.
109
In this case, the mipmaps are indexed by two indices. If no scaling occurs in the x direction, but scaling is roughly 1/2 in the y direction, we might want to use "mipmap (1,2)" (which is the 64x32 mipmap).
All in all, uniform mipmapping takes 4/3 the memory used by a texmap but has its problems, while nonuniform mipmapping makes an attempt to reduce these problems but takes 4 times as much memory as a simple texmap. Note, however, that we are fortunate enough that the amount of memory taken by nonuniform mipmapping is merely a constant times what is required for texture mapping.
Summed area tables
If we want to use a block filter (average all the texels that should go in a mipxel), we can use something perhaps more general, called a summed area table.
Let's say we have a texture map T[x][y]. We want to calculate the average of all pixels in the square delimited by say (p,q) and (r,s). (That is, the square [p,r)x[q,s).) One way is to pre-compute a summed area table of the same size as the original texture. This summed area table S is defined as follows. S[x][y] is the sum of all texels T[m][n] for m<x, n<y. Then it is easy to see that the sum of all texels in the (p,q)-(r,s) square is Q=S[r,s]-S[p,s]-S[r,q]+S[p,q]. Then the mean is M=Q/([r-p]x[s-q]).
110
This allows us to apply one very special type of filter to axis aligned boxes in the texture map relatively quickly. The probem is, most of the time, the texels that cover a pixel we are rendering do not form an axis aligned box in the texture map. There are also other issues: the block filter is not a tremendously attractive one, the filter should depend on the relative space taken up by each texel on screen, and so on.
