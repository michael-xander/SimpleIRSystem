the surface the same. The correct normal vector for the back side is the negative of the normal vector for the front side, and the correct dot product is (-N)•L. We can handle both cases if we simply use abs(N•L). For L = (0,0,1), that would be abs(N.z). If color is a vec3 giving the diffuse color of the surface, the visible color can be computed as
vec3 visibleColor = abs(N.z) * color;
If color is instead a vec4 giving an RGBA color, only the RGB components should be multiplied by the dot product:
vec4 visibleColor = vec4( abs(N.z)*color.rgb, color.a );
The sample program webgl/cube-with-basic-lighting.html implements this minimal lighting model. The lighting calculations are done in the vertex shader. Part of the scene is drawn without lighting, and the vertex shader has a uniform bool variable to specify whether lighting should be applied. Here is the vertex shader source code from that program:
attribute vec3 a_coords;            // Object coordinates for the vertex.
uniform mat4 modelviewProjection;   // Combined transformation matrix.
uniform bool lit;            // Should lighting be applied?
uniform vec3 normal;         // Normal vector (in object coordinates).
uniform mat3 normalMatrix;   // Transformation matrix for normal vectors.
uniform vec4 color;          // Basic (diffuse) color.
varying vec4 v_color;        // Color to be sent to fragment shader.
void main() {
    vec4 coords = vec4(a_coords,1.0);
    gl_Position = modelviewProjection * coords;
    if (lit) {
        vec3 N = normalize(normalMatrix*normal); // Transformed unit normal.
        float dotProduct = abs(N.z);
        v_color = vec4( dotProduct*color.rgb, color.a );
    }
    else {
        v_color = color;
    }
}
It would be easy to add ambient light to this model, using a uniform variable to specify the ambient light level. Emission color is also easy.
The directional light used in this example is technically only correct for an orthographic projection, although it will also generally give acceptable results for a perspective projection. But the correct viewpoint light for a perspective projection is
