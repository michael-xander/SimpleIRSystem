The quality measure used for evaluating the shape of
polygonal mesh faces is based on the condition number
shape measure [20]. This measure is derived from the
Jacobian matrix of an element mapping as described
below.
Consider a vertex, Vi, connected to a set of edges,
EðViÞ, and faces, FðViÞ, as shown in Fig. 2. Assume that
one of the faces, Fj 2 FðViÞ, has edges Ep 2 EðViÞ and
Eq 2 EðViÞ connected to vertex Vi. The triangle formed
by edges Ep and Eq can always be mapped to a rightangled
triangle in 2D space with Vi mapped to the origin,
a unit vector, e¢p, representing Ep along the x-axis
and a unit vector, e¢q, representing Eq along the y-axis in
2D space. Then, the Jacobian matrix, Jji, of the mapping
of the triangle to the right-angled triangle in 2D space
evaluated at vertex Vi, is given by Jji ¼ ½ ep eq  where,
ep and eq are 3D edge vectors, of lengths lp and lq, representing
edges Ep and Eq, respectively. The condition
number of the Jacobian matrix is defined as

jF is the Frobenius norm
of its matrix operand.
Since Jji is a 3·2 matrix for a triangle in 3D, its
inverse does not exist in the usual sense and a pseudoinverse
has to be calculated by singular value decomposition
methods. On the other hand, the Jacobian
matrix of a triangle in 2D space is a 2·2 matrix whose
condition number can be calculated more easily as:
This is the first stage of the RJM optimization strategy.
In this step, the locally optimal position of each mesh
vertex is computed with respect to the fixed position of
its neighbors. The objective function for optimization is
the local condition number function, ~w
ci
, described in
Eq. 5, in the section titled ‘‘Condition number based
optimization’’. However, in this step, the vertex is not
moved to its locally optimal position. Rather, the optimal
position of each vertex, described by a base face and
the parametric coordinates of the vertex in the base face,
is stored as a virtual position for use in the second stage
of the mesh improvement procedure.
