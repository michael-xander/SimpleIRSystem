Our first step is an interactive boundary curve painting phase
wherein a modeler defines the boundaries of a number of
patches. This is accomplished with tools that allow the painting
of curves directly on the surface of the unparameterized
polygonal model. Here, the connectivity of the polygon mesh
allows the use of local graph search algorithms to make curve
painting operations rapid. This property is useful when a
modeler wishes to experiment with different boundary curve
configurations for the same model. Each region of the mesh
that a B-spline surface must be fit to is called a polygonal
patch. Since patch boundaries have been placed for artistic
reasons, polygonal patches are not constrained to be height
fields. Our only assumptions about them are that each is a
rectangularly parameterizable piece of the surface that has no
holes.
2. In the next step we generate a gridded resampling for each
polygonal patch. This is accomplished by an automatic
coarse-to-fine resampling of the patch, producing a regular
grid that is constrained to lie on the polygonal surface. We
call this grid the spring mesh. Its purpose is to establish
a parameterization for the unparameterized surface. Our
resampling algorithm is a combination of relaxation and
subdivision steps that iteratively refine the spring mesh at a
given resolution to obtain a better sampling of the underlying
polygonal patch. This refinement is explicitly directed by
distortion metrics relevant to the spline fit. The output of this
step is a fine gridding of each polygonal patch in the model.
3. We now use standard gridded data fitting techniques to fit a Bspline
surface to the spring mesh corresponding to each polygonal
patch. The output of this step is a set of B-spline patches
that represent the coarse geometry of the polygonal model. To
represent fine detail, we also compute a displacement map for
each patch as a gridded resampling of the difference between
the spring mesh and the B-spline surface. This regular sampling
can conveniently be represented as a vector (rgb) image
which stores a 3-valued displacement at each sample location.
Each of these displacements represents a perturbation in the
local coordinate frame of the spline surface. This image representation
lends itself to a variety of interesting image processing
operations such as compositing, painting, edge detection
and compression. An issue in our technique, or in any technique
for fitting multiple patches to data is ensuring continuity
between the patches. We use a combination of knot line
matching and a stitching post-process which together give us
G1 continuity everywhere. This solution is widely used in the
entertainment industry.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section
2 reviews relevant previous work. Section 3 describes our techniques
for painting boundary curves over polygonal meshes. Section
4 presents our coarse-to-fine, polygonal patch resampling algorithm
and the surface fitting process. Section 5 describes our strategy
for extracting displacement maps and some interesting applications
thereof. Section 6, discusses techniques for dealing with continuity
across patch boundaries. Finally, section 7 concludes by discussing
future work.
Throughout this paper we will draw on examples from the entertainment
industry. However, our techniques are generally applicable.
2 Previous work
There is a large literature on surface fitting techniques in the CAD,
computer vision and approximation theory fields. We focus here on
only those techniques from these areas that use dense (scanned) data
of arbitrary topology to produce smooth surfaces. We can classify
such surface fitting techniques as manual, semi-automated and automated.
2.1 Manual techniques
Manual approachescan be divided into two categories. The first category
includes all methods for digitizing a physical model directly.
For example, using a touch probe, one can acquire only data that is
relevant to the final surface model. Catalogues of computer models
published by ViewPoint Data Labs and the work of Pixar’s animation
group [24, 28] exemplify these methods. These methods involve
human intervention throughout the data acquisition process
and are hence time-consuming, especially if the model is complex
or the data set required is large. In contrast, our pipeline employs
automatic data acquisition methods [9].
The second category uses scanned data as a template to assist
in the model construction process. Point cloud or triangulated data
is typically imported into a conventional modeling system. A user
then manually projects isolated points to this data as a means of determining
the locations of control points (or edit points [15]) for
smooth parametric surfaces. These methods require less human intervention
than those in the first category but complex models may
