Normal vectors have been used to enhance the visual appearance of (mostly
polyhedral) geometrical objects in numerous ways ever since the introduction
of Phong shading. Perhaps the best known example is bump mapping
(introduced by Blinn [1978]) but also displacement mapping [Cook 1984]
and environment mapping [Blinn and Newell 1976] may be thought of as
part of the Phong heritage. With the introduction of refraction in raytracing
[Whitted 1980], normals not only serve to compute the amount of
reflected light, but also to compute the direction of the refraction rays.
Also in modeling, normal vectors play a crucial role: for example, in the
polyhedron modeling system of Allan et al. [1989] modifications of a
polygon mesh can be made by shifting vertices in a direction normal to the
mesh. More recently, with the advent of constraint-based modeling systems
(e.g., the Mallet system [Mallet 1992]), normal vectors serve as a shaping
device in that a surface may be required to be perpendicular to a given
direction in a given point. The use of normal vectors, or rather tangent
vectors, in specifying tensor product surfaces has been well known since
the introduction of Hermite patches [Boehm et al. 1984].
Some authors have questioned the adequacy of the traditional two-fold
linear interpolation of normal vectors while scan-converting polygons for
rendering. Shoemake [1985] recommends the use of quaternion rotation,
rather than linear interpolation for the interpolation for orientations, to
arrive at a smoother appearance; Duff [1979] notes that the traditional
two-fold linear interpolation is not affine invariant which causes highlights
to move in a nonrealistic manner over rotating objects. Duff describes a

method based on barycentric coordinates for curing this flaw. Also the
necessity of repeated renormalization of normal vectors has been subject to
investigation; Bishop and Weimer [1986] give an algorithm that circumvents
this costly operation.
3. WHERE THE VERTEX NORMALS ORIGINATE
For polyhedral models, considered as a stream of polygons, vertex normals
are often calculated as a process separate from Phong shading. Phong
shading normally consists of, for every scanline, linear interpolation of
vertex normals to produce edge normals at the extremes of that scanline,
and subsequently, for every pixel, interpolating between these edge normals
to find the normal vector in the pixel. Indeed, providing for normal
vectors in the vertices can be argued to be part of the modeling process.
Especially in the case of CSG modeling [Requicha 1980] or other types of
modeling that are based on assembling a scene from instantiations of a
limited (parameterized) set of geometrical polyhedral primitives, generating
the normal vectors together with the locations of the vertices is the
most obvious thing to do, provided that the geometrical primitives are
closed shapes. For example, for a sphere, irrespective of the number of
polygons that is used to approximate its shape, the normal vectors are
generally all assumed to point in radial directions.
Even if the geometric model is not assembled from a set of closed
polyhedra, normal vector assignments can be rather straightforward. Consider,
for example, a geometrical model that is the isovalue surface of a
well-chosen potential function (as in Wyvill and Wyvill [1989]). Here it is
guaranteed that the surface is orientable; moreover, in a polyhedral approximation
of such a surface, every vertex is completely surrounded by
polygonal facets that are all part of the surface. Then a normal vector can
be assigned to every vertex by appropriate averaging [Rogers and Adams
1976] of the normal vectors of the surrounding facets. (There is, however, a
problem here: it is not a priori clear what weights should be applied to the
normals when averaging.)
Also in the case where the polygons are consistently oriented (all clockwise
or all counterclockwise), assigning normal vectors is a straightforward
task, and the standard algorithms such as in Newman and Sproull [1979]
and Rogers and Adams [1976] are perfectly adequate.
It is not always possible, however, to guarantee consistent orientation for
an arbitrary polygon mesh. First of all, if the polygon mesh is not a
manifold, there may not exist one global consistent orientation; as we
discuss later, it may be necessary then to identify several subsets of the
mesh that are manifolds and orient each manifold individually. Second,
even if the polygon mesh represents one orientable manifold, globally
consistent orientation may be hard to guarantee a priori, depending on the
modeling technique used. For instance, in a free-hand 3D geometric design
environment where a user may add vertices, edges, and polygons in an
arbitrary order, nothing is known about the relative orientation of these

polygons, and achieving a globally consistent orientation requires a separate
processing step.
This is the situation we consider in the current section: the geometric
model studied here consists of a set of vertices and a set of faces; a face is
just a cyclic list of vertices. This means that nothing is known a priori of
the topology: an edge of a face may be shared not only by two but also by
one, three, or more faces.1
The algorithm suggested here for obtaining vertex-normal vectors consists
of three passes. These are explained intuitively; a (somewhat more)
formal definition of the geometry is introduced, and the second and third
passes of the algorithm are described in terms of the formal definitions.
3.1 Intuitive Description
Normal vector interpolation between adjacent faces may only be expected
to yield an intuitively clear result if these faces share exactly one edge
where this edge is not shared by any other face. Such a pair of faces, say f1
and f2 are called good neighbors, abbreviated by f1 ?? f2. The relation ??
induces a transitive closure ??* . Here f1
?*? f2 means that either
f1 ?? f2
or
? f3: f1 ?? f3: f3 ?*? f2 .
In other words, the relation f1
?*? f2 exists if f1 and f2 are connected
eventually via a series of ?? relationships. Note that if f1 and f2 share an
edge, say e, and also f1
?*? f2, it
