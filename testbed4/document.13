Here is a sketch of how environment mapping can be implemented. The first
thing you need to do is to compute the environment map. First off remove the reflective object from your
environment. Place a small sphere or cube about the center of the object. It should be small enough that it
does not intersect any of the surrounding objects. (You may actually use any convex object for this purpose.
Spheres and cubes each have advantages and disadvantages. We will assume the case of a cube in the rest of
the discussion.) Project the entire environment onto the six faces of the cube, using the center of the cube as
the center of projection. That is, take six separate pictures which together form a complete panoramic picture
of the surrounding environment, and store the results in six image files. It may take some time to compute these
images, but once they have been computed they can be used to compute reflections from all different viewing
positions.
By the way, an accurate representation of the environment is not always necessary. For example, to simulate a
shiny chrome-finished surface, a map with varying light and dark regions is probably good enough to fool the
eye. This is called chrome mapping. But if you really want to simulate a mirrored surface, a reasonably accurate
environment map is necessary.
Now suppose that we want to compute the color reflected from some point on the object. As in the Phong model
we compute the usual vectors: normal vector ~n, view vector ~v, etc. We compute the view reflection vector ~rv
from these two. (This is not the same as the light reflection vector, ~r, which we discussed in the Phong model,
but it is the counterpart where the reflection is taken with respect to the viewer rather than the light source.)
To determine the reflected color, we imagine that the view reflection vector ~rv is shot from the center of the
cube and determine the point on the cube which is hit by this ray. We use the color of this point to color the
corresponding point on the surface. (We will leave as an exercise the problem of mapping a vector to a point on
the surface of the cube.) The process is illustrated below.

Note that the final color returned by the environment map is a function of the contents of the environment image
and ~rv (and hence of ~v and ~n). In particular, it is not a function of the location of the point on the surface.
Wouldn’t taking this location into account produce more accurate results? Perhaps, but by our assumption that
objects in the environment are far away, the directional vector is the most important parameter in determining
the result. (If you really want accuracy, then use ray tracing instead.)
Reflection mapping through texture mapping: OpenGL does not support environment mapping directly, but there
is a reasonably good way to “fake it” using texture mapping. Consider a polygonal face to which you want to
apply an environment map. They key question is how to compute the point in the environment map to use in

computing colors. The solution is to compute this quantities yourself for each vertex on your polygon. That
is, for each vertex on the polygon, based on the location of the viewer (which you know), and the location of
the vertex (which you know) and the polygon’s surface normal (which you can compute), determine the view
reflection vector. Use this vector to determine the corresponding point in the environment map. Repeat this for
each of the vertices in your polygon. Now, just treat the environment map as though it were a texture map.
What makes the approach work is that when the viewer shifts positions, you will change the texture coordinates
of your vertices. In normal texture mapping, these coordinates would be fixed, independent of the viewer’s
position.
