This sketch describes a simple way to set up coefficients
to implement quadratic shading in rendering hardware.
Quadratic shading interpolates a second-order shading
function to provide quality comparable to per-pixel Phong
shading,1 at a fraction of the complexity and with no restrictions
on the number of light sources or the type of lighting.
Simple adaptive algorithms allow software and hardware to
fall back to Gouraud shading.
Triangle Preparation
Fig. 1 shows a triangle with lighting computed at six positions:
vertex colors L, M, and N, and edge midpoint colors Q, R, and
S. Any lighting algorithm may be used to produce these colors.
Edge midpoint colors need not be computed or transmitted
to the rendering hardware if they are similar to the values
produced by Gouraud shading. This may be determined by
existing adaptive algorithms for subdividing Gouraud shaded
triangles.2
Fig. 1 also defines the M and N vertex coordinates (x1, y1)
and (x2, y2), as well as terms i = x2/x1, j = y1/y2, and
k = 1–| i j | . The vertex with color L is translated to the origin
and must be at a corner of the triangle’s bounding box. As in
the figure, assign the vertices such that i and j are no greater
than 2, which is possible except for co-incident vertices. This
reduces the numerical precision required for quadratic shading.
Quadratic Function Coefficients
We want to define a quadratic shading function
I (x, y) = ax2 + bxy + cy2 + dx + ey + f that evaluates to
the specified color values at the six sample points. Equations
(1) define five intermediate color values. Equations (2) define
the six coefficients. T/2, U/2, and (T + U - 2V)/2 measure
the worst-case difference between Gouraud shading and
quadratic shading on the three edges, which occurs at edge
midpoints. Rendering hardware may compare these to a
threshold to select whether to fall back to Gouraud shading.
Phong shading on this patch. Fig. 3
graphs quadratic shading on two triangles using colors computed
at nine points, three of which are shared between the
two triangles. The result is quite similar to per-pixel Phong
shading.
Fig. 4 graphs eight triangles that are Gouraud shaded using
the same nine colors. This result produces artifacts such as
Mach banding and a displaced, dimmer specular highlight.
Animation exacerbates these problems. Eliminating the artifacts
requires further triangle subdivision and many more
Phong-lighting computations than quadratic shading requires
