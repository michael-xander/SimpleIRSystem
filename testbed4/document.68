Our two-step approach of gridding and then fitting has several desirable
characteristics. First, it is fast. This can be understood as
follows. At each level of subdivision, each spring mesh point must
traverse some fraction of the polygons as it relaxes. The cost of this
relaxation thus depends linearly on size of the polygon mesh. It obviously
also depends on the size of the spring mesh. If these two
were equal, as would occur if we immediately subdivided the spring
mesh to the finest level, then the cost of running the relaxation would
be O(n2). If, however, we employ the coarse-to-fine strategy described
in the foregoing sections, then at each subdivision level, four
times as many spring mesh points move as on the previous (coarser)
level, but they move on average half as far. Thus, the cost of relaxation
at each subdivision level is linear in the number of spring mesh
points, and the total cost due to relaxation is O(n log n). This argument
breaks down if we start with a large initial set of iso-curves.
Similar arguments apply to the cost of subdivision.
A second advantage of our overall strategy is that it allows a user
to pause the iteration at an intermediate stage and still obtain good
quality previews of the model. This is a useful property for an interactive
system, specially when dealing with large meshes. In particular,
subdivision to higher levels can be postponed until the model
designer is satisfied with a patch configuration.
A third advantage of our approach is that once the resampling is
done, the spline resolution can be changed interactively, since no
further parameter re-estimation is necessary. We have found this to
be a useful interactive tool for a modeler, specially when making the
tradeoff between explicitly represented geometry and displacement
mapped detail as explained in section 5.
As mentioned earlier, there are other schemes that may be used to
parameterize irregular polygon meshes. In particular, the harmonic
maps of Eck et al[11] produce parameterizations with low edge and
aspect ratio distortions. However, the scheme has two main drawbacks
for our purposes. First, it can cause excessive area distortions
in parameter space. Second, the algorithm employs an O(n2) iteration
to generate final parameter values for vertices of the mesh and
no usable intermediate parameterizations are produced. As pointed
In conclusion, we have presented fast techniques for fitting smooth
parametric surfaces, in particular tensor product B-splines, to dense,
irregular polygon meshes. A useful feature of our system is that it
allows incremental previewing of large patch configurations. This
feature is enabled by our coarse-to-fine gridded resampling scheme
and proves invaluable when modelers wish to experiment with different
patch configurations of the same model. We also provide a
useful method for storing and manipulating fine surface detail in the
form of displacement map images. We have found that this representation
empowers users to manipulate geometry using tools outside
our modeling system.
Our system has several limitations. First, becauseit relies on surface
walking strategies and mesh connectivity to resample polygonal
patches, it breaks down in the presence of holes in the polygon
mesh. However, new range image integration techniques include
methods for filling holes.
Another limitation is that B-spline surface patches, our choice to
represent coarse geometry, perform poorly for very complex surfaces
such as draped cloth. B-splines have other disadvantages as
well, such as the inability to model triangular patches without excessive
parametric distortion. Despite these limitations, B-splines
(and NURBS in general) are widely used in the modeling industry.
This has been our motivation for choosing this over other representations.
There are a number of fruitful directions for future research.
Straightforward extensions include developing tools to assist in
boundary curve painting and editing, improving robustness in the
presence of holes, adding further constraints to the the parameterization
process, allowing variable knot density at the fitting stage,
implementing other continuity solutions, and using adaptive spring
grids for sampling decimated meshes. An example of a boundary
painting tool is a “geometry-snapping” brush that attaches curves to
features as the user draws on the object. Examples of constraints to
the parameterization process include interactively placed curve and
point “attractors” within a patch.
An interesting application of the parameterization portion of our
system is the interactive texture mapping and texture placement [26]
for complex polygonal models. Related to this is the possibility
of applying procedural texture analysis/synthesis techniques [17] to
create synthetic displacement maps from real ones. Using our techniques
such maps can be applied to objects of arbitrary topology.
