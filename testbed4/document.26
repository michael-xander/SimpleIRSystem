The efficiency of the geometric modeling algorithms presented in this tutorial crucially depends
on the underlying mesh data structures. A variety of data structures has been described in the
literature, and a number of different implementations are available. We refer to [Ket98] for an
excellent overview and comparison of different mesh data structures and to [FH03, FH05b] for
references on data structures for representing non-manifold meshes.
In general, when choosing a data structure one has to take into account topological as well as
algorithmic considerations:
Topological requirements. Which kinds of meshes need to be represented by the data structure?
Do we need boundaries or can we assume closed meshes? Do we need to represent complex
edges and singular vertices (see Chapter 4) or can we rely on a manifold mesh? Can we restrict
ourselves to pure triangle meshes or do we need to represent arbitrary polygonal meshes? Are
the meshes regular, semi-regular or irregular? Do we want to build up a hierarchy of differently
refined meshes or do we need only a flat data structure?
Algorithmic requirements. Which kinds of algorithms will be operating on the data structure?
Do we simply want to render the mesh? Do we need to modify only the geometry of the mesh,
or do we also have to modify the connectivity/topology? Do we need to associate additional
data with the vertices, edges or faces of the mesh? Do we need to have constant-time access to
the local neighborhoods of vertices, edges and faces? Can we assume the mesh to be globally
orientable?
The simplest representation for triangle meshes would just store a set of individual triangles.
Some data exchange formats use this representation as a common denominator (e.g., STL format).
However, it is immediately clear that this is not sufficient for most requirements: connectivity
information cannot be accessed explicitly, and vertices and associated data are replicated.
The latter can be fixed by a shared vertex data structure, which stores a table of vertices and encodes
triangles as triples of indices into this table. In fact this representation is used in many file
formats because it is simple and efficient in storage (assuming no mesh compression is applied).
Similarly, it is efficient for certain algorithms that assume static data, e.g., rendering. However,
without additional connectivity information this is still not efficient for most algorithms.
Before we go on, we want to identify some minimal set of operations that are frequently used
by most algorithms.
• Access of individual vertices, edges, faces. This includes enumeration of all elements (in
no particular order).
• Oriented traversal of edges of a face, which refers to finding the next edge in a face. (This
defines also degree of the face and the inverse operation for the previous halfedge. With
additional access to vertices, e.g., rendering of faces is enabled.)
