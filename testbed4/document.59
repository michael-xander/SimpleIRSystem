Since the very early days of 3D raster computer graphics, polyhedral
representation of geometry has been supported. Specified typically
as a list of vertices, edges, and faces, arbitrary geometry can
be expressed. These representations, such as winged-edge data
structures (cf. [6]), were as much designed to support editing of the
geometry as display. Nowadays vestiges of these representations
live on as interchange formats (for example, Wavefront OBJ).
While theoretically compact, some of the compaction is given up
for readability by use of ASCII representation of the data in interchange
files. Also, few of these formats are set up to be directly
passed to rendering hardware as drawing instructions. Another historical
vestige is the support of n-sided polygons in such formats.
While early rendering hardware could accept such general primitives,
nearly all of today’s (very much faster) hardware mandates
that all polygon geometry be reduced to triangles before being submitted
to hardware. Polygons with more than three sides cannot in
general be guaranteed to be either planar or convex. If quadrilaterals
are accepted as rendering primitives, the fine print somewhere
indicates that they will be (arbitrarily) split into a pair of triangles
before rendering. In keeping with this modern reality, we restrict
geometry to be compressed to triangles.
Modern graphics languages specify binary formats for the representation
of collections of 3D triangles, usually as arrays of vertex data
structures. PHIGS PLUS, PEX, XGL, and proposed extensions to
OpenGL are of this form. These formats define the storage space
taken by executable geometry today.
Triangles can be isolated or chained in “zig-zag” or “star” strips. Iris-
GL, XGL, and PEX 5.2 define a form of generalized triangle strip that
can switch from a zig-zag to star-like vertex chaining on a vertex by
vertex basis (at the expense of an extra header word per vertex in XGL
The first stage of geometry compression is to convert triangle data
into an efficient linear strip form: the generalized triangle mesh. This
is a near-optimal representation of triangle data, given fixed storage.
The existing concept of a generalized triangle strip structure allows for
compact representation of geometry while maintaining a linear data
structure. That is, the geometry can be extracted by a single monotonic
scan over the vertex array data structure. This is very important for pipelined
hardware implementations, a data format that requires random access
back to main memory during processing is very problematic.
However, by confining itself to linear strips, the generalized triangle
strip format leaves a potential factor of two (in space) on the table.
Consider the geometry in figure 1. While it can be represented
by one triangle strip, many of the interior vertices appear twice in
the strip. This is inherent in any approach wishing to avoid references
to old data. Some systems have tried using a simple regular
mesh buffer to support re-use of old vertices, but there is a problem
with this in practice: in general, geometry does not come in a perfectly
regular rectangular mesh structure.
The generalized technique employed by geometry compression addresses
this problem. Old vertices are explicitly pushed into a
queue, and then explicitly referenced in the future when the old vertex
is desired again. This fine control supports irregular meshes of
nearly any shape. Any viable technique must recognize that storage
is finite; thus the maximum queue length is fixed at 16, requiring a
4-bit index. We refer to this queue as the mesh buffer. The combination
of generalized triangle strips and mesh buffer references is
referred to as a generalized triangle mesh.
The fixed mesh buffer size requires all tessellators/re-strippers for
compressed geometry to break up any runs longer than 16 unique references.
Since geometry compression is not meant to be programmed
directly at the user level, but rather by sophisticated tessellators/re-formatters,
this is not too onerous a restriction. Sixteen old vertices allows
up to 94% of the redundant geometry to avoid being re-specified.
Figure 1 also contains an example of a general mesh buffer representation
of the surface geometry.
The language of geometry compression supports the four vertex replacement
codes of generalized triangle strips (replace oldest, replace
middle, restart clockwise, and restart counterclockwise), and
adds another bit in each vertex header to indicate if this vertex
should be pushed into the mesh buffer or not. The mesh buffer reference
command has a 4-bit field to indicate which old vertex
should be re-referenced, along with the 2-bit vertex replacement
code. Mesh buffer reference commands do not contain a mesh buffer
push bit; old vertices can only be recycled once.
Geometry rarely is comprised purely of positional data; generally a
normal and/or color are also specified per vertex. Therefore, mesh
buffer entries contain storage for all associated per-vertex information
(specifically including normal and color). For maximum space
efficiency, when a vertex is specified in the data stream, (per vertex)
normal and/or color information should be directly bundled with the
position information. This bundling is controlled by two state bits:
bundle normals with vertices (bnv), and bundle colors with vertices
(bcv). When a vertex is pushed into the mesh buffer, these bits control
if its bundled normal and/or color are pushed as well. During a mesh
buffer reference command, this process is reversed; the two bits specify
if a normal and/or color should be inherited from the mesh buffer
storage, or inherited from the current normal or current color. There
are explicit commands for setting these two current values. An important
exception to this rule occurs when an explicit “set current normal”
command is followed by a mesh buffer reference, with the bnv
state bit active. In this case, the former overrides the mesh buffer normal.
This allows compact representation of hard edges in surface geometry.
The analogous semantics are also defined for colors, allowing
compact representation of hard edges in textures.
Two additional state bits control the interpretation of normals and colors
when the stream of vertices is turned into triangles. The replicate
normals over triangle (rnt) bit indicates that the normal in the final vertex
that completes a triangle should be replicated over the entire triangle.
The replicate colors over triangle (rct) bit is defined analogously.
4 COMPRESSION OF XYZ POSITIONS
The 8-bit exponent of 32-bit IEEE floating-point numbers allows positions
literally to span the known universe: from a scale of 15 billion
light years, down to the radius of sub-atomic particles. However for
any given tessellated object, the exponent is really specified just once
by the current modeling matrix; within a given modeling space, the
object geometry is effectively described with only the 24-bit fixedpoint
mantissa. Visually, in many cases far fewer
