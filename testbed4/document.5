Last time we presented the basic elements of affine and Euclidean geometry:
points, vectors, and operations such as affine combinations. However, as of yet we have no mechanism for
defining these objects. Today we consider the lower level issues of how these objects are represented using
coordinate frames and homogeneous coordinates.
The first question is how to represent points and vectors in affine space. We will begin by recalling how to do
this in linear algebra, and generalize from there. We will assume familiarity with concepts from linear algebra.
(If any of this seems unfamiliar, please consult any text in linear algebra.) We know from linear algebra that if
we have 2-linearly independent vectors, ~u0 and ~u1 in 2-space, then we can represent any other vector in 2-space
uniquely as a linear combination of these two vectors:
~v = _0~u0 + _1~u1;
for some choice of scalars _0, _1. Thus, given any such vectors, we can use them to represent any vector in
terms of a triple of scalars (_0; _1). In general d linearly independent vectors in dimension d is called a basis.
Fig. 22: Bases and linear combinations in linear algebra (a) and the standard basis (b).
Now, let us consider 3-space. The most familiar basis, called the standard basis, is composed of the three unit
vectors. In linear algebra, you probably learned to refer to these unit vectors by the corresponding coordinate
vectors, for example:
These vectors have the nice property of being of length 1 and are all mutually orthogonal. Such a basis is called
an orthonormal basis. Because it will be inconvenient to refer to column vectors in the text, we will often use
the T symbol (which denotes transpose) to express them more succinctly. For example, we could also write
~ex = (1;0; 0)T . With very few exceptions all vectors will be represented as column vectors.
Note that we are using the term “vector” in two different senses here, one as a geometric entity and the other as
a sequence of numbers, given in the form of a row or column. The first is the object of interest (i.e., the abstract
data type, in computer science terminology), and the latter is a representation. As is common in object oriented
programming, we should “think” in terms of the abstract object, even though in our programming we will have
to get dirty and work with the representation itself.
Since these three vectors are linearly independent, they form a basis. Given any vector in 3-space, we can
represent it as a linear combination of these vectors:
contains the Cartesian coordinates of the vector ~v.
Coordinate Frames and Coordinates: Now let us turn from linear algebra to affine geometry. To define a coordinate
frame for an affine space we would like to find some way to represent any object (point or vector) as a sequence
of scalars. Thus, it seems natural to generalize the notion of a basis in linear algebra to define a basis in affine
space. Note that free vectors alone are not enough to define a point (since we cannot define a point by any
combination of vector operations). To specify position, we will designate an arbitrary a point, denoted O, to
serve as the origin of our coordinate frame. Observe that for any point P, P -O is just some vector ~v. Such a
vector can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of basis vectors. Thus, given the origin point O and
any set of basis vectors ~ui, any point P can be expressed uniquely as a sum of O and some linear combination
of the basis vectors:
P = _0~u0 + _1~u1 + _2~u2 + O;
for some sequence of scalars _0, _1, _2. This is how we will define a coordinate frame for affine spaces. In
general we have:
Definition: A coordinate frame for a d-dimensional affine space consists of a point, called the origin (which
we will denote O) of the frame, and a set of d linearly independent basis vectors.

w . We have also given two coordinate frames, F and G.
Observe that P and

w can be expressed as functions of F and G as follows:
P = 3_F:~e0 + 2 _ F:~e1 + F:O

w = 2_F:~e0 + 1 _ F:~e1
P = 1_G:~e0 + 2 _ G:~e1 + G:O

w = -1 _ G:~e0 + 0 _ G:~e1
Notice that the position of

w is immaterial, because in affine geometry vectors are free to float where they like.

The Coordinate Axiom and Homogeneous Coordinates: Recall that our goal was to represent both points and vectors
as a list of scalar values. To put this on a more formal footing, we introduce the following axiom.
Coordinate Axiom: For every point P in affine space, 0 _ P = ~0, and 1 _ P = P.
This is a violation of our rules for affine geometry, but it is allowed just to make the notation easier to understand.
Using this notation, we can now write the point and vector of the figure in the following way.
P = 3_F:~e0 + 2 _ F:~e1 + 1 _ F:O
-!
w = 2_F:~e0 + 1 _ F:~e1 + 0 _ F:O
Thus, relative to the coordinate frame F = hF:~e0; F:~e1; F:Oi, we can express P and
-!
w as coordinate vectors
relative to frame F as
We will call these homogeneous coordinates relative to frame F. In some linear algebra conventions, vectors are
written as row vectors and some as column vectors. We will stick with OpenGL’s conventions, of using column
vectors, but we may be sloppy from time to time.
As we said before, the term “vector” has two meanings: one as an free vector in an affine space, and now as a
coordinate vector. Usually, it will be clear from context which meaning is intended.
In general, to represent points and vectors in d-space, we will use coordinate vectors of length d+1. Points have
a last coordinate of 1, and vectors have a last coordinate of 0. Some authors put the homogenizing coordinate
first rather than last. There are actually good reasons for doing this. But we will stick with standard engineering
conventions and place it last.

Properties of homogeneous coordinates: The choice of appending a 1 for points and a 0 for vectors may seem to
be a rather arbitrary choice. Why not just reverse them or use some other scalar values? The reason is that this
particular choice has a number of nice properties with respect to geometric operations.
For example, consider two points P and Q whose coordinate representations relative to some frame F are
P[F] = (3;2; 1)T and Q[F] = (5;1; 1)T , respectively. Consider the vector
~v = P - Q:
If we apply the difference rule that we defined last time for points, and then convert this vector into it coordinates
relative to frame F, we find that ~v[F] = (-2;1; 0)T . Thus, to compute the coordinates of P -Q we simply take
the component-wise difference of the coordinate vectors for P and Q. The 1-components nicely cancel out, to
give a vector result.

In general, a nice feature of this representation is the last coordinate behaves exactly as it should. Let U and V
be either points or vectors. After a number of operations of the forms U + V or U - V or _U (when applied to
the coordinates) we have:
_ If the last coordinate is 1, then the result is a point.
_ If the last coordinate is 0, then the result is a vector.
_ Otherwise, this is not a legal affine operation.
This fact can be proved rigorously, but we won’t worry about doing so.
This suggests how one might do type checking for a coordinate-free geometry system. Points and vectors
are stored using a common base type, which simply consists of a 4-element array of scalars. We allow the
programmer to perform any combination of standard vector operations on coordinates. Just prior to assignment,
check that the last coordinate is either 0 or 1, appropriate to the type of variable into which you are storing the
result. This allows much more flexibility in creating expressions, such as:
centroid   P + Q + R
3 ;
which would otherwise fail type checking. (Unfortunately, this places the burden of checking on the run-time
system. One approach is to define the run-time system so that type checking can be turned on and off. Leave it
on when debugging and turn it off for the final version.)
Alternative coordinate frames: Any geometric programming system must deal with two conflicting goals. First, we
want points and vectors to be represented with respect to some universal coordinate frame (so we can operate
on points and vectors by just operating on their coordinate lists). But it is often desirable to define points relative
to some convenient local coordinate frame. For example, latitude and longitude may be a fine way to represent
the location of a city, but it is not a very convenient way to represent the location of a character on this page.

What is the most universal coordinate frame? There is nothing intrinsic to affine geometry that will allow us
to define such a thing, so we will do so simply by convention. We will fix a frame called the standard frame
from which all other objects will be defined. It will be an orthonormal frame, meaning that its basis vectors are
orthogonal to each other and each is of unit length. We will denote the origin by O and the basis vectors by ~ei.
The coordinates of the elements of the standard frame (in 3-space) are defined to be:
Change of coordinates (example): One of the most important geometric operations in computer graphics is that of
converting points and vectors from one coordinate frame to another. Recall from the earlier figure that relative
