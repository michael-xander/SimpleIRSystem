2.3.3  Rotation
A rotation transform, for our purposes here, rotates each point about the origin, (0,0). Every point is rotated through the same angle, called the angle of rotation. For this purpose, angles can be measured either in degrees or in radians. (The 2D graphics APIs that we will look at later in this chapter use radians, but OpenGL uses degrees.) A rotation with a positive angle rotates objects in the direction from the positive x-axis towards the positive y-axis. This is counterclockwise in a coordinate system where the y-axis points up, as it does in my examples here, but it is clockwise in the usual pixel coordinates, where the y-axis points down rather than up. Although it is not obvious, when rotation through an angle of r radians about the origin is applied to the point (x,y), then the resulting point (x1,y1) is given by
x1 = cos(r) * x - sin(r) * y
y1 = sin(r) * x + cos(r) * y
That is, in the general formula for an affine transform, e = f = 0, a = d = cos(r), b = -sin(r), and c = sin(r). Here is a picture that illustrates a rotation about the origin by the angle negative 135 degrees:
 
Again, the light gray "F" is the original shape, and the dark red "F" is the shape that results if you apply the rotation. The arrow shows how the upper left corner of the original "F" has been moved.
A 2D graphics API would typically have a command rotate(r) to apply a rotation. The command is used before drawing the objects to which the rotation applies.

2.3.4  Combining Transformations
We are now in a position to see what can happen when you combine two transformations. Suppose that before drawing some object, you say
translate(4,0)
rotate(90)
