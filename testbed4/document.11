We have discussed the use of lighting as a method of producing more realistic images. This is fine
for smooth surfaces of uniform color (plaster walls, plastic cups, metallic objects), but many of the objects that
we want to render have some complex surface finish that we would like to model. In theory, it is possible to try
to model objects with complex surface finishes through extremely detailed models (e.g. modeling the cover of
a book on a character by character basis) or to define some sort of regular mathematical texture function (e.g. a
checkerboard or modeling bricks in a wall). But this may be infeasible for very complex unpredictable textures.
Textures and Texture Space : Although originally designed for textured surfaces, the process of texture mapping can
be used to map (or “wrap”) any digitized image onto a surface. For example, suppose that we want to render a
picture of the Mona Lisa. We could download a digitized photograph of the painting, and then map this image
onto a rectangle as part of the rendering process.
There are a number of common image formats which we might use. We will not discuss these formats. Instead,
we will think of an image simply as a 2-dimensional array of RGB values. Let us assume for simplicity that
the image is square, of dimensions N  N (OpenGL requires that N actually be a power of 2 for its internal
representation). Images are typically indexed row by row with the upper left corner as the origin. The individual
RGB pixel values of the texture image are often called texels, short for texture elements.
Rather than thinking of the image as being stored in an array, it will be a little more elegant to think of the image
as function that maps a point (s; t) in 2-dimensional texture space to an RGB value. That is, given any pair
(s; t), 0  s; t  1, the texture image defines the value of T(s; t) is an RGB value.
For example, if we assume that our image array Im is indexed by row and column from 0 to N - 1 starting
from the upper left corner, and our texture space T(s; t) is coordinatized by s (horizontal) and t (vertical)

from the lower left corner, then we could apply the following function to round a point in image space to the
corresponding array element:
T(s; t) = Im[b(1 - t)Nc ; bsNc]; for s; t 2 (0; 1):
This is illustrated in Fig. 50.

In many cases, it is convenient to imagine that the texture is an infinite function. We do this by imagining that
the texture image is repeated cyclically throughout the plane. This is sometimes called a repeated texture. In
this case we can modify the above function to be
T(s; t) = Im[b(1 - t)Nc mod N; bsNc mod N]; for s; t 2 R:
Parameterizations: We wish to “wrap” this 2-dimensional texture image onto a 2-dimensional surface. We need
to define a wrapping function that achieves this. The surface resides in 3-dimensional space, so the wrapping
function would need to map a point (s; t) in texture space to the corresponding point (x; y; z) in 3-space.
This is typically done by first computing a 2-dimensional parameterization of the surface. This means that we
associate each point on the object surface with two coordinates (u; v) in surface space. Then we have three
functions, x(u; v), y(u; v) and z(u; v), which map the parameter pair (u; v) to the x; y; z-coordinates of the
corresponding surface point. We then map a point (u; v) in the parameterization to a point (s; t) in texture
space.
Let’s make this more concrete with an example. Suppose that our shape is the surface of a unit sphere centered
at the origin. We can represent any point on the sphere with two angles, representing the point’s latitude and
longitude. We will use a slightly different approach. Any point on the sphere can be expressed by two angles,
 and . (These will take the roles of the parameters u and v mentioned above.) Think of the vector from the
origin to the point on the sphere. Let  denote the angle in radians between this vector and the z-axis (north
pole). So  is related to, but not equal to, the latitude. We have 0    . Let  denote the counterclockwise
angle of the projection of this vector onto the xy-plane. Thus 0    2. (This is illustrated in Fig. 51.)
What are the coordinates of the point on the sphere as a function of these two parameters? The z-coordinate is
just cos , and clearly ranges from 1 to -1 as  increases from 0 to . The length of the projection of such a
vector onto the x; y-plane will be sin . It follows that the x and y coordinates are related to the cosine and sine
of angle , respectively, but scaled by this length. Thus we have
z(; ) = cos ; x(; ) = cos  sin ; y(; ) = sin  sin :
If we wanted to normalize the values of our parameters to the range [0; 1], we could reparameterize by letting
u = 1-(=) and v = =(2). (The reason for subtracting = from 1 is that its value decreases as we
go from bottom to top, and having it increase is more natural.) Thus, u implicitly encodes a function of the
latitude ranging from 0 at the so
