Moreover, the consequent use of triangle meshes as surface
representation avoids error-prone conversions, e.g., from
CAD surfaces to mesh-based input data of numerical simulations.
Besides classical geometric modeling, other major
areas frequently employing triangle meshes are computer
games and movie production. In this context geometric models
are often acquired by 3D scanning techniques and have to
undergo post-processing and shape optimization techniques
before being actually used in production.
This course discusses the whole geometry processing
pipeline based on triangle meshes. We will first introduce
general concepts of surface representations and point out the
advantageous properties of triangle meshes in Chapter 2, and
present efficient data structures for their implementation in
Chapter 3.
The different sources of input data and types of geometric
and topological degeneracies and inconsistencies are described
in Chapter 4, as well as techniques for their removal,
resulting in clean two-manifold meshes suitable for
further processing. Mesh quality criteria measuring geometric
smoothness and element shape together with the corresponding
analysis techniques are presented in Chapter 6.
Mesh smoothing reduces noise in scanned surfaces by generalizing
signal processing techniques to irregular triangle
meshes (Chapter 7). Similarly, the underlying concepts from
differential geometry are useful for surface parametrization
as well (Chapter 8). Due to the enormous complexity of
meshes acquired by 3D scanning, mesh decimation techniques
are required for error-controlled simplification (Chapter
9). The shape of triangles, which is important for the
robustness of numerical simulations, can be optimized by
general remeshing methods (Chapter 10).

1 Introduction
After optimizing meshes with respect to the different quality criteria, we finally present techniques
for intuitive and interactive shape deformation (Chapter 11). Since solving linear systems
is a commonly required component for many of the presented mesh processing algorithms, we
will discuss their efficient solution and compare several existing libraries in Chapter
The efficient processing of geometric objects requires — just like in any other field of computer
science — the design of suitable data structures. For each specific problem in geometry processing
we can identify a characteristic set of operations by which the computation is dominated and
hence we have to choose an appropriate data structure which supports the efficient implementation
of these operators. From a high level point of view, there are two major classes of surface
representations: parametric representations and implicit representations.
The common definition of a surface in the context of computer graphics applications is that
of an orientable continuous two-dimensional manifold embedded in IR3. Intuitively, this can
be understood as the boundary surface of a non-degenerate three-dimensional solid where nondegenerate
means that the solid does not have any infinitely thin parts or features such that the
surface properly separates the “interior” and “exterior” of the solid. A (non-closed) surface with
boundaries is one that can be extended into a proper boundary surface by filling the holes.
Since in most applications the raw information about the input surface is obtained by discrete
sampling
