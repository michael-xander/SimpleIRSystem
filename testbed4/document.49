Once that is done with the help of ray tracing or Z buffer as you can see this ray can be visualized either as a ray traced backward to the direction of the light source or also could be visualized as at light rays coming out from the 3D screen and impinging on the projection plane. Well, if you are interested on a particular point (X, Y) on the screen this point will be illuminated due to the shading effect of the nearest polygon at that point which is this one let us say. That is what you have to see. And if you remember, we discussed about ray casting in the last lecture. That is easy to visualize with respect to this diagram. The intensity or that particular point (X, Y) on the image plane can be visualized as the intensity obtained due to that point on the polygon in 3D.
Now when you retrace the path of the light ray back and strike the polygon you have to basically illuminate that pixel based on the intensity reflected by the polygon at that particular point. And the question comes is how much of a light ray will be reflected by a polygon or a point on the polygon or on an object, that is the key and we have to model that process and find out how much amount of light is reflected from an object point towards the viewer or the projection plane. Well, it depends on various factors, just to name a few factors it depends on the light source, it could depend on the number of light sources.
If you have more than one light source so there could be various types of light sources and at various positions in the screen which are radiating light. Of course typically if you say that you are visualizing an outdoor scene then of course you have only one light source which is the sun. But typically if you take a class room or an indoor environment you may have multiple light sources radiating light equally may be and unequally may be in different directions. That is the first thing which you have to model.
The second thing is you must find out how much fraction of the light source emitted by the light source or the light sources one or two light sources may be there in the scene and a very small percentage of that light falls on a particular object on that too in a small planar patch represented by a polygon and that too one particular pixel. So, a particular pixel will also receive some amount of light. And depending upon the surface properties, the most important surface property being the surface reflectance property dictates how much amount of light will be reflected from that surface which will actually determine the amount of light which will be reflected away from the surface.
That means there is some amount of light which is falling on a surface and something is reflected back. Something could be absorbed, something could be reflected back along a particular channel like a single ray or it could be diverse and equally dissipated in all directions. Several things may happen depending upon the surface property. That is what is going to happen and that is what we have to model. But there are other problems which will come in.
Number one is we have to model, we have already seen that we have to model a light source or multiple light sources, number one. We have to model different parts of the object which may have different colors and difference reflectance properties.
We discussed about reflectance properties just now and we will see mathematical equations which are used to model such a reflectance properties. Now it could be possible that the light could be of a particular color and the surface object itself could be some other color. Let us say we are working in a white or yellow light environment and we are viewing an object which could be radar or bluing color. So, depending upon the surface color and the surface reflectance properties and depending upon the illumination color or the intensity you may visualize different types of shades of colors and intensities of a particular sheet. These are the various facts. First of all we have to model and what are you trying to do? When you are trying to create a scene either is a question of virtual reality environment or to give virtual realism which we discussed about in ray tracing or VSD algorithms.
If you look at reality for that matter in a class room type of a scenario or an indoor environment you may have one or multiple light sources. It is quite difficult for you to visualize based on what viewing angle and what direction and what point, how much amount of the light you are seeing, why? It is because a scene may have various objects. Each of these objects will have different types of parts, different colors, different reflectance properties and there could be multiple light sources. There could be a scenario where the amount of light source impinging on an object, some part of that light ray suppose the light source is here and some amount of light falls here on the object, some section of that will reflect along that certain direction. You have another object at that point which will again reflect the light and so on. So there could be multiple reflections which are possible.
I am not saying multiple reflections in the case where you have only multiple mirrors. The object themselves produce inter reflections. It is possible that a light ray may fall on object number one, go to object number two, go to object number three and come back to object number one, this is reality. In fact, truly speaking, in reality there are uncountable number of rays, infinite amount of rays which are traveling around in the universe and also in space and also in the classroom even with a single light source. And what happens is, then of course you should ask a question when you are viewing it with your own eye, how can you view it.
Yes you can when you also use a digital camera you view, but what do you view? At a particular given point of time or when you are looking along a particular direction with your eye which is the natural sensor or the digital camera which is an artificial sensor among all the different rays virtually you can imagine almost infinite number or infinite amount of rays. Infinite rays are reflected in all directions with different lighting and propositions and different intensities. You can visualize that using a digital camera in a small region. In a small aperture you are capturing only a small section of those light rays but that is what you have to model as well. With our eye also you can rotate and see in a classroom right now and what you will be seeing is you are orienting an aperture through
which if the light rays are falling on your retina or the human eye. So, among all the different rays which are traveling in front of you, you are only seeing a section of those rays which are passing through your eye lens through the aperture and falling on the retina which is sensitive to certain light intensities.
Similarly, in a digital camcorder or a digital camera for that matter you have the sensitive charge coupled devices which will transform the light to electrical energy. But at any given point of time you cannot capture all the rays for a particular snapshot or a screen but you are only capturing a smaller section of the those rays. What are those rays constituting of? Some of those rays could be even such that could be directly coming from the source one or two more. But your viewing object most of them are getting reflected by the object and coming towards you that too from different objects of course at any particular given pixel point of pixel (x, y) you will of course be seeing only one particular point of an object that is true. And of course the amount of the light which is again reflected depends upon the surface reflectance properties a perfect log object will have 0 reflectance.
Then you can have something like a snow or a silver which will reflect almost all of the light which is it proceeds. So there are various degrees of reflectivity of surfaces which you have starting from absolute dark absolute bright and grey colors and definite shades and intensities and colors in between. Those are the different rays which first of all could be directly reflected on to the projection plane or view plane in this case for computer graphics. It could be the case that these objects which you are viewing in addition to direct rays of the sun or the light source which it is receiving, it also receives inter reflected light rays from the object transmitted to this. That is what you see here that this particular light ray which is reflected from this object point of the polygon to the projection plane could be resulting due to rays of light which could fall directly from this source to the projection plane at this point or rays indirectly coming from or reflected from different objects one or two more objects and then falling all of that again on this point and then reflected back. This concept happens at each particular pixel on the projection plane as well as on each object point which is reflecting the ray.
So you have all source of rays coming from all different directions impinging on the object or object points and the object points also radiate or reflect back these light rays may be in all directions may be towards a particular direction depending upon various properties of the surface on the object which are termed as reflectance properties or color of the surface.
Well, you see if you want to model this entire thing in a typical scenario in a classroom if you see and I did say sometime back uncountable number of rays, infinite rays exist in a 3D space even in and around the environment and there is no way you can model this accurately enough to give the impression that it is a true picture. But still the computer scientist and other engineers working in the field of visual realism, virtual reality, computer graphics cannot stop, we have to create pictures for various applications which we have seen from the beginning of the scenes.
So we will make certain assumptions and see how to model this process of illumination and shading because so far I have tried to give an idea about how difficult this problem is or in computer science terms what is called as the shading is a very hard problem. That is the point which we start now that the process of illumination and shading is a hard problem and I hope in the last two minutes I have tried to give you an illustration or describe why shading is a very hard problem. So we need to create a virtual reality, say a classroom as I was talking about sometime back of a real scene which involves, there are various methods by which the shading and illumination is done for complex 3D scenes.
We need to model and position several complex objects in that 3D scene. That we have seen in the first stage of the 3D graphics pipeline. But once that is done you determine using the Visual Surface Detection algorithms, find the visible surface at any
