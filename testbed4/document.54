You cannot have a very good approximation of a highly sharp bend curve or surfaces which has a sharp rather small radius of curvature to be approximated by simple polygons. So we have to have curves and that to in many applications a single curve whatever format you choose you will look into special forms of cubic parametric curves of splines and Bezier curves which are highly efficient to fit to certain points. They are also not able to handle curves which oscillate quiet rapidly.
Sharp transitions frequently occurring, we might say that it may not be in some sense periodic. But periodic type signals with sharp curvatures of surfaces and contours it is often difficult to fit a single curve. You can try to force that with a higher degree polynomial use some interpolation extrapolation techniques and try to fit but it will always be a very coarse approximation.
So what often is done is, we will see later on that a highly complex curve is also broken up into smaller segments and each of the segments are represented by these various types of curve representation. And it is necessary to bind these sections of curves at the end points which are typically done by the help of these blending functions which control in nature and the manner in which these curves will start from the starting point and finish at the ending point.
Of course we have not seen the figure yet we will see that very soon. I was talking of this example in the previous class where I asked you to visualize that a plane must take off in a certain way and land up in certain angle in an air strap. It cannot rise up or fall at any
arbitrary angles larger than or greater than something or even less than something because that could cause a problem.
So we are talking of trying to fit certain trajectories and smooth it with the help of blending function. That is an example of mathematical blending function here. The T dot M is a blending function here. Keep this idea in mind Q is equal to T M G is a representation which we will come back to later on.
We start with the first of the popular representation called the cubic splines which are used to represent curves and the expression is given in the following manner; Parametric representation P of t; summation of four terms B of i is what are called for the time being you can say these are some points, control point which control the manner in which the curve will take its shape. And of course you can see that t is raised to the power two and since i is equal to 1 to 4 the maximum highest order of t will be three and hence the term cubic spline.
t varies from the range t1 to t2 and Pt is the position vector of any point on the cubic spline segment. So, when we vary t form t1 to t2 you are basically moving on the curve or P of t is a position vector pointing to any point on the curve from the starting point when t is equal to t1 and you reach the finishing point or end point of the curve when t equals t2.

We will see the role of the Bis later on. But before that, we will have a look into the P of t which itself could be a three element vector in Cartesian coordinate form x y z. You can use homogeneous representation but since x y z are the three elements which are required I am putting those or you could use cylindrical Cartesian coordinate.
Cylindrical coordinate form R theta and z or even the spherical form or theta fi. So whatever may be the case this cubic spline holds good.
But of course you cannot straight away mix up any of these two representations and start using in your application or theory. You must stick to one of the forms of Cartesian cylindrical and spherical and then write this expression for cubic splines. We break open the elements and we stick to Cartesian coordinate form and Bi is will now have the three components Bix, Biy and Biz for the x y and z coordinates respectively. t varies in the same range. The indices and the t to the power i – 1 is the same. So the B which we had in the previous slide is now broken up into three components. So we will have 3 into 4 is equal to 12 coefficients for the Bis.

So you can visualize P of t now if you break open and write it in series form with i equals 1 where we have t to the power 0 which is B1, B2t, B3t square and B4t cube, t varies from again to t1 to t2. And each of these elements B1, B2, B3 and B4 that is any Bi for i varying from 1 to 4 will also have three components I will say Bix Biy Biz. So 4 into 3 there are twelve coefficients of these parameters which control the shape of the cubic spline. That means if you change anyone of these Bis you will have a different type of a curve. But the problem to do with cubic spline is just to compute this Bis because you know this range from t1 to t2 where the t could vary.
For the time being you can visualize that the t1 could be 0, t2 could be some value of capital t. So you are varying from 0 to T say the t value, the parameter and you need to fit the cubic spline over the set of points and you need to compute these Bi. So the question comes is how to compute these Bis. We will see here how to use the boundary conditions to evaluate these coefficients.
Remember, there are four of these B1, B2, B3, B4 which are Bis and each of the coefficients Bis will have individual three components along x, y and z respectively. So basically although there are 12 coefficients but we will visualize each of these Bis as a
vector, if you take B1 it will have B1x, B1y and B1z. So, each of this Bis is a three element column vector. So we will visualize Bis as column vector and whatever we write as a equation we will assume that or we must consider that we are writing a vector equation not a scalar one and it has to be broken up into three components x y z to obtain the individual components of the Bis along x, y and z respectively. I hope you are able to follow this point that if B1 has three components B1x, B1y and B1z then B4 also will have B4x, B4y and B4z respectively. So let us see how the boundary conditions are used to evaluate the coefficients.

We took a derivative, let us take the derivative of this P of t, if you remember which was the P of t expression was sigma Bi t to the power i – 1. If you remember the expression, I can say it again; P of t was sigma Bi t to the power i – 1. So if you take the derivative what happens? So i – 1 will come out and this is the nature which you have. So this is the expression which you have and after taking it, this indicates that you have taken the derivative.
So del P of del t, this P prime indicates derivative of P with respect to t. If you do that with respect to any of these expression as given here do not worry about this x, you just assume that P of t is Bi t to the power i – 1. This is what if you take along x, y or z the combined vector equation in the differential domain will be something like this. And if you see that the B1 term will vanish because when we assume that we are talking about this in fact the range runs from i is equal to 1. I must admit here that i is equal to 2 here. i is equal to 2 to 4 that is why it gives you 2, 3 and 4 the three coefficients because the B1 term will vanish after the differentiation because it is a constant point.
So if you know that this is the expression which you obtained and if you are satisfied that this is the expression which you obtained after differentiation and this is the curve.
Let
