Occlusion culling is a genre of algorithms for rapidly eliminating portions of three-dimensional geometry hidden
behind other, visible objects prior to passing them to the rendering pipeline. In this paper, an extension to the
popular shadow frustum culling algorithm is presented, which takes into account the fact that many planar
occluders can be grouped into compound convex solids, which in turn can provide fewer and larger culling frusta
and therefore more efficient elimination of hidden geometry. The proposed method combines planar and solid
occluders using a unified selection approach and is ideal for dynamic environments, as it doesn’t depend on precalculated
visibility data. The solid occluders culling algorithm has been applied to commercially deployed
virtual reality systems and test cases and results are provided from actual virtual reality shows.

1. INTRODUCTION
In dense or large three-dimensional environments, the
visible geometry consists of many hundreds of
thousands of polygons. Fortunately, most of these
primitives are not visible simultaneously from an
arbitrary vantage point. If the amount of actually
invisible (hidden) polygons that are nevertheless sent
to the graphics hardware for rendering is kept low,
the performance of the application can gain a
significant boost. The algorithms used for culling
these surfaces fall into three categories, back face
elimination, view frustum culling and occlusion
culling, the later being not so trivial as the rest.
Occlusion Culling
In occlusion culling, geometry that is hidden behind
objects closer to the camera point is discarded before
being subject to depth sorting algorithms, although
this geometry may pass the other two culling tests.
Most occlusion culling methods use planar occluders
[Hud97a] and their projections on the viewing plane.
These planar occluders are often the polygons of the
blocking geometry. Culling tests take place either in
3D space (viewer coordinate system, see Fig. 1) or in
the resulting discrete image space, after projecting
and rasterising the occluders and the potentially
hidden geometry in an image buffer. The Hierarchical
Z-Buffer [Gre93a] and the Hierarchical Occlusion
Map [Zha98a] are two good examples of the later
approach. Other techniques rely on the concept of
space partitioning in cells, which are visible through
openings, named portals, as in [Lue95a]. Binary
Space Subdivision is often utilized to automatically
segment space into cells based on the geometry
[Tel91a]. The related visibility culling techniques
may use pre-calculated information or clip entire cells
on the fly. BSP and cell-and-portal techniques work
very well for enclosed environments, such as building
interiors and are thus favored by the game
development community. Occlusion culling
techniques may pose some restrictions on navigation
freedom (non-arbitrary view location) in order to gain
simplicity and performance, as is the case in
[Dow01a]. A more extensive presentation of the
different occlusion culling methods is clearly beyond
the scope of this paper but the interested reader can
