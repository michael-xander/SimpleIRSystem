We can apply texture mapping in ray tracing just as we did in OpenGL’s rendering model.
Given the intersection of the ray with an object, we need to map this intersection point to some sort of 2-
dimensional parameterization (u; v). From this parameterization, we can then apply the inverse wrapping function
to map this point into texture coordinates (u; v).
In ray tracing there is another type of texture, which is quite easy to implement. The idea is to create a function
f(x; y; z) which maps a point in 3-space to a color. This is called a procedural texture.
We usually think of textures as 2-dimensional “wallpapers” that are wrapped around objects. The notion here is
different. We imagine that the texture covers all of 3-space and that the object is cut out of this infinite texture.
This is actually quite realistic in some cases. For example, a wood grain texture arises from the cylindrical
patterns of light and dark wood that results from the trees varying rates of growth between the seasons. When
you cut a board of wood, the pattern on the surface is the intersection of a single plane and this cylindrical
3-dimensional texture. Here are some examples.

Checker: Let C0 and C1 be two RGB colors. Imagine that we tile all of three dimensional space with a collection of
unit cubes each of side length s and of alternating colors C0 and C1. This is easiest to see in the 1-dimensional
case first. Given an x-coordinate, we divide it by s and take its floor. If the resulting number is even then we
assign the color C0 and if odd we assign C1.
checker(x) =
_
C0 if (bx=sc mod 2) = 0
C1 otherwise.
Beware: It is important to use an honest implementation of the floor function, bx=sc. Note that the integer cast
operation of programming languages such as C, C++, and Java, namely “int(x/s)” will not work properly if x is
negative. (Integer casting maps to the smaller absolute value.) Instead, on C/C++ systems use the combination,
“int(floor(x/s)),” which first computes the “honest” floor and then casts the resulting integer-valued double to an
integer.
To generalize this to 3-space, we simply apply this idea separately to each coordinate and sum the results.
checker(x; y; z) =
_
C0 if ((bx=sc + by=sc + bz=sc) mod 2) = 0
C1 otherwise.
Note that if we intersect an axis-orthogonal plane with the resulting 3-dimensional checker pattern, then the
result will be a 3-dimensional checker. If we intersect it with a non-axis aligned object (like a sphere) then the
result takes on a decidedly different appearance.
Fig. 62: 3-d checkerboard and gradient textures.
An example is shown in Fig. 62. Notice that the checkerboard appears to be distorted. Although the checkerboard
is formed of perfectly flat sides, it is being “cut out” along the curved surface of the sphere. This is whay
makes it appear to be curved. If you consider the slices along the z-axis, they would cut the sphere along a series
of circular horizontal latitude lines. These can be readily seen in the figure, as can the corresponding circles for
x and y. Thus, the texture is indeed “three-dimensional.”
Linear Gradient: A gradient is a texture that alternates smoothly between two colors C0 and C1. To explore this, let
us first consider a gradient in a 1-dimensional setting for a parameter value x. We want the color to vary back and
forth from C0 to C1. The color is C0 whenever x is an even multiple of s, that is, x 2 f: : : ;-2s; 0; 2s; 4s; : : :g,
and we want the color to be C1 whenever x is an odd multiple of s, that is x 2 f: : : ;-s; s; 3s; 5s; : : :g.
The fact that we are blending the colors suggests that we use an affine combination (1 - _)C0 + _C1, where _
varies smoothly as a function of x. To achieve smoothness, we can let _ vary as a cosine function. (See Fig. 63.)
As x varies from 0 to s, we want the blending value to vary from 0 to 1. Since the cosine function naturally
varies from 1 to -1, as x varies from 0 to _, this suggests the following transformations. First, we transform x
by mapping it to x0   _x=s. Thus, for x 2 [0; s], we have x0 2 [0; _]. Thus, cos x0 2 [1;-1]. In order to map
this to the interval [0; 1] we subtract from 1 (yielding the interval [0; 2]) and divide by 2 (yielding the interval

[0; 1]), which is exactly what we want. Thus we have the final color:

Fig. 63: Computation of the gradient texture.
In order to generalize this to 3-space, we need to define an appropriate mapping of a point P = (x; y; z) to a
one dimensional parameter. There are various ways to do this, and different ways produce different textures.
One simple method is a linear gradient, where the color is constant for all the points on a plane, and then varies
orthogonally to this plane. Such a gradient can be specified by giving an origin point Q, where the color is C0,
and some directional vector ~v, which indicates the orthogonal direction. (For example, in Fig. 62, right, the
origin might be the center of the sphere and the directional vector points up.) At the point Q+~v the color should
be C1, and Q + 2~v the color is C0, and so one.
How do we determine the color of an arbitrary point P = (x; y; z) in 3-space. The idea is that for each point P,
consider the relative length of the projection of the vector ~p = P - Q onto ~v
_ =
((P - Q) _ ~v)
(~v _ ~v) ;
and then use the value of _ to blend smoothly between C0 and C1. When _ is even, we use color C0 and
when _ is odd we use the color C1. (See Fig. 63.) Thus, _ takes the role of x in the 1-dimensional case,
and now s is simply 1. As before, we want to interpolate smoothly between these cases. To do so, we set
