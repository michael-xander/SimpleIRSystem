Advanced Real-Time Renderingin 3D Graphics and Games

Natalya Tatarchuk is a staff research engineer in the demo group of ATI's 3D Application
Research Group, where she likes to push the GPU boundaries investigating innovative graphics
techniques and creating striking interactive renderings. Her recent achievements include leading
creation of the state-of-the-art realistic rendering of city environments in ATI demo “ToyShop”. In
the past she has been the lead for the tools group at ATI Research. She has published articles in
technical book series such as ShaderX and Game Programming Gems, and has presented talks
at Siggraph and at Game Developers Conferences worldwide. Natalya holds BA's in Computers
Science and Mathematics from Boston University and is currently pursuing a graduate degree in
CS with a concentration in Graphics at Harvard University.
Chris Oat is a senior software engineer in the 3D Application Research Group at ATI where he
explores novel rendering techniques for real-time 3D graphics applications. As a member of ATI's
demo team, Chris focuses on shader development for current and future graphics platforms. He
has published several articles in the ShaderX and Game Programming Gems series and has
presented at game developer conferences around the world.
Jason L. Mitchell is a software developer at Valve Software, where he works on integrating
cutting edge graphics techniques into the popular Half-Life series of games. Prior to joining Valve
in 2005, Jason worked at ATI in the 3D Application Research Group for 8 years. He received a
BS in Computer Engineering from Case Western Reserve University and an MS in Electrical
Engineering from the University of Cincinnati.
Alex Evans started his career in the games industry writing software renderers for innovative
UK game developer Bullfrog; after completing a degree at Cambridge University he joined
Lionhead Studios full time as one of the lead 3D programmers on the hit game 'Black & White'.
His passion is the production of beautiful images through code - both in games, such as Rag Doll
Kung Fu and Black & White, but also through his work (under the name 'Bluespoon') creating
real-time visuals for musicians such as Aphex Twin, Plaid and the London Sinfonietta.
Carsten Wenzel is a software engineer and member of the R&D staff at Crytek. During the
development of FAR CRY he was responsible for performance optimizations on the CryEngine.
Currently he is busy working on the next iteration of the engine to keep pushing future PC and
next-gen console technology. Prior to joining Crytek he received his M.S. in Computer Science at
Ilmenau, University of Technology, Germany in early 2003. Recent contributions include GDC(E)
presentations on advanced D3D programming, AMD64 porting and optimization opportunities as
well articles in ShaderX 2.
Pedro V. Sander is a member of the 3D Application Research Group of ATI Research. He
received his Bachelors degree from Stony Brook University, and his Masters and PhD in
Computer Science at Harvard University. Dr. Sander has done research in geometric modeling,
more specifically efficient rendering techniques and mesh parameterization for high quality
texture mapping. At ATI, he is researching real-time rendering methods using current and next
generation graphics hardware.
