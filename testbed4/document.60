We assumed optimized generalized triangle strips, with both positions
and normals represented by floating-point values. This is how
the “original size” column was calculated. To see the effect of pure 16-
bit fixed point simple strip representation, we also show the byte count
for this mode of OpenGL (the average strip length went way down, in
the range of 2-3). Because few if any commercial products take advantage
of generalized triangle strips, the potential memory space savings
are considerably understated by the numbers in the table.
The earlier columns in the table break down the bit usage by component:
just position tag/data, just normal tag/data, and everything
else (overhead). The “quant” columns show the quantization
thresholds. All results in table 1 are (measured) actual compression,
with one exception. Because our software compressor does not yet
implement a full meshifying algorithm, we present estimated mesh
buffer results in parentheses (always next to actual results). This estimate
assumes a 42% hit ratio in the mesh buffer.
While certainly there is statistical variation between objects (with
respect to compression ratios), we have noted some general trends.
When compressing using the highest quality setting of the quantization
knobs (P48/N18), the compression ratios are typically about
6. When most objects start showing visible quantization artifacts,
the ratios are nearly 10.
10 GEOMETRY COMPRESSION SOFTWARE
So far the focus has been on the justification and description of the
geometry compression format. This section addresses some of the
issues that arise when actually performing the compression; the
next section addresses issues related to hardware and software implementation
of decompression.
An important measure for any form of compression is the ratio of the
time required for compression relative to decompression. Several otherwise
promising techniques for image compression have failed in the
marketplace because they require several thousand times more time
to compress than to decompress. It is acceptable for off-line image
compression to take 60X more time than decompression, but not too
much more; for real-time video conferencing the ratio should be 1.
Geometry compression does not have this real-time requirement.
Even if geometry is being constructed on the fly, most techniques for
creating geometry (such as CSG) take orders of magnitude more time
than displaying geometry. Also, unlike the continuous images found
in movies, in most applications of geometry compression a compressed
3D object will be displayed for many sequential frames before
being discarded. If the 3D object needs to be animated, this is typically
done with modeling matrices. Indeed for a CD-based game, it is quite
likely that an object will be decompressed billions of times by customers,
while compressed only once by the authoring company.
Like some other compression systems, geometry compression algorithms
can have a compression-time vs. compression-ratio knob.
Thus for a given target level of quality, the more time allowed for
compression, the better the compression ratio that can be achieved
by a geometry compression system. There is a corresponding knob
for quality of the resulting compressed 3D object. The lower the
quality knob, the better the compression ratio achieved.
We have found an esthetic judgment involved in geometry compression,
based upon our experiences with the system so far. Some 3D
objects start to look bad when the target quantization of normals and/
or positions is reduced even a little, others are visually unchanged
even with a large amount of quantization. Sometimes the compression
does cause visible artifacts, but may only make the object look
different, not necessarily lower in quality. Indeed in one case an elephant
started looking better (more wrinkled skin) the more we quantized
his normals! The point is that there is also a subjective compo-
captured
the spirit of the original intent in creating the model.
But once a model has been created and compressed, it can be put
into a library, to be used as 3D clip-art at the system level.
Below is an outline of the geometry compression algorithm:
1. Input explicit bag of triangles to be compressed, along with
quantization thresholds for positions, normals, and colors.
2. Topologically analyze connectivity, mark hard edges in normals
and/or color.
3. Create vertex traversal order & mesh buffer references.
4. Histogram position, normal, and color deltas.
5. Assign variable length Huffman tag codes for deltas, based
on histograms, separately for positions, normals, colors.
6. Generate binary output stream by first outputting Huffman
table initializations, then traversing the vertices in order, outputting
appropriate tag and delta for all values.
Implementation status: a compressor of Wavefront OBJ format has
been implemented. It supports compression of positions and normals,
and creates full generalized triangle strips, but does not yet
implement a full meshifying algorithm. The geometry compression
format supports many more sophisticated compression opportunities
than our existing compressor utilizes. We hope in the future to
explore variable precision geometry, and fine structured updates of
the compression tables. Eventually modelers should generate compressed
geometry directly; our current compressor spends a lot of
time figuring out geometric details that the tessellator already knew.
The current (un-optimized) software can compress ~3K tris/sec.
11 GEOMETRY DECOMPRESSION HARDWARE
While many of the techniques employed by geometry compression
are universal, some of the details were specifically designed to allow-
cost, high-speed hardware implementations. A geometry compression
format designed purely for software decompression
would, of course, be a little different.
The features that make the geometry compression instruction set
amenable to hardware implementation include: one pass sequential
processing, limited local storage requirements, tag look-up rather
than usual Hamming bit-sequential processing, and most arithmetic
is comprised of shifts, adds, and look-ups.
Below is an outline of the geometry decompression algorithm:
1. Fetch the rest of the next instruction, and the first 8 bits of the
instruction after that.
2. Using the tag table, expand any compressed value fields to
full precision.
3a.If values are relative, add to current value; otherwise replace.
3b.If mesh buffer reference, access old values.
3c.If other command, do housekeeping.
4. If normal, pass index through ROM table to obtain full
values.
5. Output values in generalized triangle strip form to next stage.
Implementation status: a software decompressor has been implemented,
and successfully decompresses compressed geometry, at a
rate of ~10K triangles/second. Hardware designs a
