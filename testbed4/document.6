Suppose you want to draw an animation of a spinning ball. How would you define the function that
maps each point on the ball to its position rotated through some given angle?
We will consider a limited, but interesting class of transformations, called affine transformations. These include
(among others) the following transformations of space: translations, rotations, uniform and nonuniform scalings
(stretching the axes by some constant scale factor), reflections (flipping objects about a line) and shearings
(which deform squares into parallelograms). They are illustrated in the figure below.
These transformations all have a number of things in common. For example, they all map lines to lines. Note that
some (translation, rotation, reflection) preserve the lengths of line segments and the angles between segments.
Others (like uniform scaling) preserve angles but not lengths. Others (like nonuniform scaling and shearing) do
not preserve angles or lengths.
All of the transformation listed above preserve basic affine relationships. (In fact, this is the definition of an
affine transformation.) For example, given any transformation T of one of the above varieties, and given two
points P and Q, and any scalar _,
R = (1-_)P +_Q ) T(R) = (1-_)T(P) + _T(Q):
(We will leave the proof that each of the above transformations is affine as an exercise.) Putting this more
intuitively, if R is the midpoint of segment PQ, before applying the transformation, then it is the midpoint after
the transformation.
There are a couple of special cases of affine transformations that are worth noting.
Rigid transformations: These transformations (also called Euclidean transformations) preserve both angles
and lengths. Examples include translations, rotations, reflections and their combinations.
Orthogonal transformations: These transformations preserve angles but not necessarily lengths. Examples
include translation, rotation, uniform scaling, and their combinations.
Homothetic transformations: These transformations preserves slopes of lines (and hence preserve angles), but
do not necessarily preserve lengths. Examples include translation, uniform scaling, and their combinations.
Matrix Representation of Affine Transformations: Let us concentrate on transformations in 3-space. An important
consequence of the preservation of affine relations is the following.
R = _0F:~e0 + _1F:~e1 + _2F:~e2 + _3O
)
T(R) = _0T(F:~e0) + _1T(F:~e1) + _2T(F:~e2) + _3T(O):
Here _3 is either 0 (for vectors) or 1 (for points). The equation on the left is the representation of a point or
vector R in terms of the coordinate frame F. This implication shows that if we know the image of the frame
elements under the transformation, then we know the image R under the transformation.

From the previous lecture we know that the homogeneous coordinate representation of R relative to frame F
is R[F] = (_0; _1; _2; _3)T . (Recall that the superscript T in this context means to transpose this row vector
into a column vector, and should not be confused with the transformation T.) Thus, we can express the above
relationship in the following matrix form.
Here the columns of the array are the representation (relative to F) of the images of the elements of the frame
under T. This implies that applying an affine transformation (in coordinate form) is equivalent to multiplying
the coordinates by a matrix. In dimension d this is a (d + 1)_(d + 1) matrix.
If this all seems a bit abstract. In the remainder of the lecture we will give some concrete examples of transformations.
Rather than considering this in the context of 2-dimensional transformations, let’s consider it in
the more general setting of 3-dimensional transformations. The two dimensional cases can be extracted by just
ignoring the rows and columns for the z-coordinates.
Translation: Translation by a fixed vector ~v maps any point P to P +~v. Note that free vectors are not altered
by translation. (Can you see why?)
Suppose that relative to the standard frame, v[F] = (_x; _y; _z; 0)T are the homogeneous coordinates
of ~v. The three unit vectors are unaffected by translation, and the origin is mapped to O + ~v, whose
homogeneous coordinates are (_x; _y; _z; 1). Thus, by the rule given earlier, the homogeneous matrix
representation for this translation transformation is
Fig. 26: Derivation of transformation matrices.
Scaling: Uniform scaling is a transformation which is performed relative to some central fixed point. We will
assume that this point is the origin of the standard coordinate frame. (We will leave the general case as
an exercise.) Given a scalar _, this transformation maps the object (point or vector) with coordinates
(_x; _y; _z; _w)T to (__x; __y; __z; _w)T .
In general, it is possible to specify separate scaling factors for each of the axes. This is called nonuniform
scaling. The unit vectors are each stretched by the corresponding scaling factor, and the origin is unmoved.
Thus, the transformation matrix has the following form:
