5.5.3 Phong Shading
Even the smoothness introduced by Gouraud shading may not prevent the appearance
of Mach bands. Phong proposed that instead of interpolating vertex intensities,
as we do in Gouraud shading, we interpolate normals across each polygon. Consider
a polygon that shares edges and vertices with other polygons in the mesh, as shown
in Figure 5.30. We can compute vertex normals by interpolating over the normals of
the polygons that share the vertex. Next, we can use interpolation, as we did in Chapter
3, to interpolate the normals over the polygon. Consider Figure 5.31. We can use
the interpolated normals at vertices A and B to interpolate normals along the edge
between them:
nC(a) = (1- a)nA
+ anB.
We can do a similar interpolation on all the edges. The normal at any interior point
can be obtained from points on the edges by
n(a, ß) = (1- ß)nC
+ ßnD.
Once we have the normal at each point, we can make an independent shading calculation.
Usually, this process can be combined with rasterization of the polygon. Until
recently, Phong shading could only be carried out off-line because it requires the interpolation
of normals across each polygon. In terms of the pipeline, Phong shading
280 Chapter 5 Lighting and Shading
requires that the lighting model be applied to each fragment, hence, the name perfragment
shading.We will implement Phong shading through a fragment shader.
5.6 APPROXIMATION OF A SPHERE
BY RECURSIVE SUBDIVISION
We have used the sphere as an example curved surface to illustrate shading calculations.
However, the sphere is not an object supported within OpenGL, so we will
generate approximations to a sphere using triangles through a process known as recursive
subdivision, a technique we introduced in Chapter 2 for constructing the
Sierpinski gasket. Recursive subdivision is a powerful technique for generating approximations
to curves and surfaces to any desired level of accuracy. The sphere
approximation provides a basis for us to write simple programs that illustrate the
interactions between shading parameters and polygonal approximations to curved
surfaces.
Our starting point is a tetrahedron, although we could start with any regular
polyhedron whose facets could be divided initially into triangles.2 The regular tetrahedron
is composed of four equilateral triangles, determined by four vertices. We
start with the four vertices (0, 0, 1), (0, 2
v
2/3, -1/3), (-
v
6/3, -
v
2/3, -1/3), and
(
v
6/3, -
v
2/3, -1/3). All four lie on the unit sphere, centered at the origin. (Exercise
5.6 suggests one method for finding these points.)
We get a first approximation by drawing a wireframe for the tetrahedron. We
specify the four vertices as follows:
point4 v[4]= {vec4(0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0),
vec4(0.0, 0.942809, -0.333333, 1.0),
vec4(-0.816497, -0.471405, -0.333333, 1.0),
vec4(0.816497, -0.471405, -0.333333, 1.0)};
We then put the vertices into an array
point4 data[12];
so we can display the triangles using line loops. Each triangle adds three points to this
array using the function
static int k = 0;
void triangle(point4 a, point4 b, point4 c)
{
data[k]= a;
2. The regular icosahedron is composed of 20 equilateral triangles; it makes a nice starting point for
generating spheres. See [Shr10].

k++;
data[k] = b;
k++;
data[k] = c;
k++
}
All the data for the tetrahedron is put into data as follows:
void tetrahedron()
{
triangle(v[0], v[1], v[2]);
triangle(v[3], v[2], v[1]);
triangle(v[0], v[3], v[1]);
triangle(v[0], v[2], v[3]);
}
The order of vertices obeys the right-hand rule, so we can convert the code to draw
shaded polygons with little difficulty. If we add the usual code for initialization, setting
up a vertex buffer object and drawing the array, our program will generate an
image such as that in Figure 5.32: a simple regular polyhedron, but a poor approximation
to a sphere.
We can get a closer approximation to the sphere by subdividing each facet of the
tetrahedron into smaller triangles. Subdividing into triangles will ensure that all the
new facets will be flat. There are at least three ways to do the subdivision, as shown
in Figure 5.33. We can bisect each of the angles of the triangle and draw the three
bisectors, which meet at a common point, thus generating three new triangles. We
can also compute the center of mass (centroid) of the vertices by simply averaging
them and then draw lines from this point to the three vertices, again generating three
triangles. However, these techniques do not preserve the equilateral triangles that
make up the regular tetrahedron. Instead—recalling a construction for the Sierpinski
gasket of Chapter 2—we can connect the bisectors of the sides of the triangle, forming
four equilateral triangles, as shown in Figure 5.33(c). We use this technique for our
example.
After we have subdivided a facet as just described, the four new triangles will
still be in the same plane as the original triangle. We can move the new vertices that

282 Chapter 5 Lighting and Shading
we created by bisection to the unit sphere by normalizing each bisected vertex, using
the normalization function normalize in vec.h. We can now subdivide a single
triangle, defined by the vertices a, b, and c:
point4 v1, v2, v3;
v1 = normalize(a + b);
v2 = normalize(a + c);
v3 = normalize(b + c);
triangle(a, v2, v1);
triangle(c, v3, v2);
triangle(b, v1, v3);
triangle(v1, v2, v3);
We can use this code in our tetrahedron routine to generate 16 triangles rather than
4, but we would rather be able to repeat the subdivision process n times to generate
successively closer approximations to the sphere. By calling the subdivision routine
recursively, we can control the number of subdivisions.
First, we make the tetrahedron routine depend on the depth of recursion by
adding an argument n:
void tetrahedron(int n)
{
divide_triangle(v[0], v[1], v[2], n);
divide_triangle(v[3], v[2], v[1], n);
divide_triangle(v[0], v[3], v[1], n);
divide_triangle(v[0], v[2], v[3], n);
}
The divide_triangle function calls itself to subdivide further if n is greater than
zero but generates triangles if n has been reduced to zero. Here is the code:
void divide_triangle(point4 a, point4 b, point4 c, int n)
{
point4 v1, v2, v3;
if (n>0)
{
v1 = normalize(v[a] + v[b]);
v2 = normalize(v[a] + v[c]);
v3 = normalize(v[b] + v[c]);
divide_triangle(a ,v2, v1, n-1);
divide_triangle(c ,v3, v2, n-1);
divide_triangle(b ,v1, v3, n-1);
divide_triangle(v1 ,v2, v3, n-1);
}
else triangle(a, b, c);
}
