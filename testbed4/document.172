Occlusion Culling
he data for occlusion culling is composed of cells. Each cell is a subdivision of the entire bounding volume of the scene. More specifically the cells form a binary tree. Occlusion Culling uses two trees, one for View Cells (Static Objects) and the other for Target Cells (Moving Objects). View Cells map to a list of indices that define the visible static objects which gives more accurate culling results for static objects.
It is important to keep this in mind when creating your objects because you need a good balance between the size of your objects and the size of the cells. Ideally, you shouldn’t have cells that are too small in comparison with your objects but equally you shouldn’t have objects that cover many cells. You can sometimes improve the culling by breaking large objects into smaller pieces. However, you can still merge small objects together to reduce draw calls and, as long as they all belong to the same cell, occlusion culling will not be affected.
You can use the ‘overdraw’ scene rendering mode to see the amount of overdraw that is occuring, and the stats information pane in the game view to see the amount of triangles, verts, and batches that are being rendered. Below is a comparison of these before and after applying occlusion culling.
 Notice in the Overdraw scene view, a high density of overdraw as many rooms beyond the visible walls are rendered. These aren’t visible in the game view, but nonetheless time is being taken to render them.
