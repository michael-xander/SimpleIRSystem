If these two functional forms represent a non-linear surface, it could be a cone, it could be a cylinder, it could be a sphere or any other arbitrary surface depending upon the coefficients, six of those we have seen in the x y but you can have more of those when you have three variables x y z. So if you have two arbitrary surfaces nonplanar curved surfaces in 3D, intersections of those will produce not a line but it will produce a curve. A typical example is, try to visualize an in

come up with a conic section also but it will be any general curve depending upon the relative positions of the sphere and the cone.
We discussed about a conic section between intersection of a cone and a plane. That intersection gives you a contour which is called a conic section. But two different quadratic surfaces or second degree or curved surfaces as they are called popularly they will intersect to form a curve. You can visualize any sphere, ellipse, ellipsoids or even cylinders and cones intersect, any two of these will interse

simultaneously satisfied will have a curve in 3D. That is what we are talking about, intersection of the above two surfaces represents a curve. Examples, this is the parametric form. The x t cube t square and t we are talking about a non-parametric representation, explicit non-parametric representation or parametric representation in the form of t cube explicit where of course since in this case you can put x equals x, y equals x square and z equals x cube can be visualized as the parametric form, this is an explicit parametric form. And parametric space curve can be represented

We can define lambda and mu in terms of another parameter d theta and c but this is highly complex. I will tell you what this curve on this base on the seam of a base ball means. That is not a very popular game in our country but it is very popular in the west. Talk of the curve on the seam of a base ball which is thrown in a very fast speed, the tennis ball which

sphere but it is quiet a curve and that can also be represented in the parametric form and it is not very easy.
I ask you to refer into a book, I do not have the example of that particular curve right now in the presentation but you can look into book by the Rogers and Adams and other books which talks of these illustrations of the curve on the of the baseball which will be represented in x y and z in this particular form

where is in this particular range two pi t where t varies between 0 and 1. So if you vary t from 0 to 1 theta will vary from 0 to 2pi and you are basically tracing the curve on the seam of the base ball that is very interesting. Interesting complex formulation but interesting vary t from 0 to 1, theta varies from 0 to 2pi and you are tracing the curve only. Helix is a very interesting example. This is something like the polar coordinate form or

a circular on an ellipse. So it is basically a circle, I can put r1 and r2 and make it an elliptical structure but helix has a circle base and the z varies linearly, b is not equal to 0 it is a positive number or negative number. We are talking of a helix like a spring type of structure so when you vary that x y follows a circular pattern but z varies. So when you vary t, x y varies in a two dimensional plane like a circle and z varies linearly. It could goes up or goes down based on the positive or negative value of b will di
