Using the octree, the visibility algorithm is intuitively clear. We start with the root
node in the octree (the largest cube) the following procedure. (1) Check if the cube
intersects with the viewing frustrum. If not, quit. (2) Scan convert the faces of the
cube to find out whether any part of the cube is visible. If not, quit. (3) Scan convert
the polygons associated with the cube, recursively process the child nodes of the cube
in front-to-back order.
However, step 2 in this procedure might take quite long time using traditional Zbuffer
scan conversion. To reduce the cost of determining the cube visibility,HZB uses
a Z-pyramid. The lowest level of this pyramid contains the values from the original
Z-buffer. Each group of 2x2 values on one level is then combined into one value on
the next level by choosing the farthest value of Z from these four values. Thus the
value on top of the Z-pyramid represents the farthest Z-value in the whole image (see
figure 1).
In order to use the Z pyramid to test the visibility, we do the following for the cube
faces and the polygons of the mode. (1) Find the finest-level value of the pyramid
whose corresponding image region covers the projection of the polygon. (2) If this
Z-value is nearer than the closest Z-value of the polygon, the polygon is totally hidden
and we can quit. (3) Otherwise divide the projection of polygon into four and move
to finer level of the pyramid. (4) If we reach the lowest level of the pyramid, we have
found a visible pixel.
In addition, HZB uses a temporal coherence list that contains all visible cubes from
the previous frame. Before starting the algorithm, all nodes in the list are rendered.
This forms an initial Z-buffer, which can be used as a basis for the Z-pyramid. If there
is enough coherence in the frames, it is quite likely that all visible geometry has been
rendered. This makes the Z-pyramid test very effective. After rendering the frame, we
remove the non-visible cubes from the list by using the Z-pyramid test on them.
The main weakness of HZB is its reliance on Z-pyramid. Z-pyramid is too slow to
be constructed in software, and current hardware is either not capable of or too slow
in answering the so called Z-query: given the current Z-buffer, are there any visible
3
pixels in a polygon? This means that HZB cannot really come up to interactive speeds.
Some newest hardware chipsets are now becoming available that support the needed
Z-buffer query. But it seems that there are better and faster algorithms that exploit this
Z-query (see for example chapter 2.3).
2.2 BSP tree projection algorithm
BSP tree projection algorithm (Naylor, 1992) uses the same ideas as HZB: eliminate
large portions of model with hierarchical structures. Instead of an octree, it uses a
more complex structure: binary space partitioning tree (BSP tree).
A BSP tree is a binary tree in which each node represents a plane (or a line in 2D).
The left subtree of a node corresponds to the negative half-space of the plane and the
right subtree to the positive half-space. For example, figure 2 shows a 2D BSP tree.
Figure 2: A BSP tree and the corresponding partitioning of a plane. Lines are denoted
by letters and regions by numbers.
If the model consists entirely of polyhedrons, then the whole model could be represented
as a BSP tree. If we attach a simple in/out variable with the leaf nodes,
then the in region corresponds to a region inside a polyhedron. This means that no
additional data structures are needed: BSP tree is the model itself.
The algorithm starts to transform the BSP tree recursively from near to far. Whenever
the algorithm encounters a face of the model (a plane that has a region in as its
direct child), it constructs a small BSP tree that represents the volume occluded by that
face. (See figure 3.) The formed BSP tree is united with the model tree, thus eliminating
redundant nodes. In the union, every subtree that has identical in/out regions is
collapsed into a single leaf. This means that the whole volume that is occluded by the
face is collapsed into a single leaf.
The reliance on the BSP tree as a model is the main weakness of the BSP projection
algorithm. Majority of models are given in other formats, such as boundary
representations (B-reps). These models must be converted to BSP trees, and it is a bit
complicated process. First of all it requires the use of heuristic choices presented by
Naylor, otherwise the resulting algorithm might not be output sensitive. Second, it assumes
that there are polygons on all object boundaries, only on object boundaries and
that all polygon normals point out of the objects. As Sudarsky and Gotsman (Sudarsky
& Gotsman, 1997) point out, actually only a few models meet these requirements.

2.3 cPLP
Algorithms in chapters 2.1 and 2.2 approached the visibility problem quite similarly.
Another approach is presented in (Klosowski & Silva, 2001), which introduces a conservative
occlusion culling algorithm, cPLP.
A conservative algorithm produces an image that looks just like the image rendered
with all polygons (it contains no errors). This kind of algorithm can overestimate the
output set, but never underestimate it. Examples of these algorithms are HZB (see
chapter 2.1) and cPLP.
An approximate algorithm produces an image that is mostly correct; it makes a
tradeoff between correctness and speed. On some applications, fast rendering is more
important than correct output. The Prioritized-Layered Projection (PLP) algorithm is
one such example (Klosowski & Silva, 2000). It is an aggressive culling algorithm that
renders only those polygons that are most likely to be visible from the given viewpoint.
The algorithm works on a user-given budget, and stops when the budget has been
reached.
Just like HZB and BSP, PLP divides the object-space into no
