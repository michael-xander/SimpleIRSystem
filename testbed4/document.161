7.2.1  Minimal Lighting
Even very simple lighting can make 3D graphics look more realistic. For minimal lighting, I sometimes use what I call a "viewpoint light," a white light that shines from the direction of the viewer into the scene. In the simplest case, a directional light can be used. Ineye coordinates, a directional viewpoint light shines in the direction of the negative z-axis. The light direction vector (L in the above diagram), which points towards the light source, is (0,0,1).
To keep things minimal, let's consider diffuse reflection only. In that case, the color of the light reflected from a surface is the product of the diffuse material color of the surface, the color of the light, and the cosine of the angle at which the light hits the surface. The product is computed separately for the red, green, and blue components of the color. We are assuming that the light is white, so the light color is 1 in the formula. The material color will probably come from the JavaScript side as a uniform or attribute variable.
The cosine of the angle at which the light hits the surface is given by the dot product of the normal vector N with the light direction vector L. In eye coordinates, L is (0,0,1). The dot product, N•L or N•(0,0,1), is therefore simply N.z, the z-component of N. However, this assumes that N is also given in eye coordinates. The normal vector will ordinarily come from the JavaScript side and will be expressed in object coordinates. Before it is used in lighting calculations, it must be transformed to the eye coordinate system. As discussed in Subsection 7.1.4, to do that we need a normal transformation matrix that is derived from the modelview matrix. Since the normal vector must be of length one, the GLSL code for computing N would be something like
vec3 N = normalize( normalMatrix * normal );
where normal is the original normal vector in object coordinates, normalMatrix is the normal transformation matrix, and normalize is a built-in GLSL function that returns a vector of length one pointing in the same direction as its parameter.
There is one more complication: The dot product N•L can be negative, which would mean that the normal vector points away from the light source (into the screen in this case). Ordinarily, that would mean that the light does not illuminate the surface. In the case of a viewpoint light, where we know that every visible surface is illuminated, it means that we are looking at the "back side" of the surface (or that incorrect normals were specified). Let's assume that we want to treat the two sides of
