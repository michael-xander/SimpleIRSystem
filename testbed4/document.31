Shaft Occlusion Culling (Schauffler, 2000)
_ Cell based, operates in object space
_ One of the first cell-based schemes that could handle 3D scenes
_ Applications: Visibility preprocessing for walkthroughs, ray tracing
with area lights.
_ Represent view cells using AABBs
_ Quadtree describes the occluding power of scene
_ Leaf node is either opaque, boundary or empty

Shaft Occlusion Culling:Method
_ Starting from view cell, traverse quadtree for opaque node
_ Traversal is performed outwards from the view cell to maximize occlusion
_ Extend occluder along the coordinate axis that gives the largest angle
from view cell to occluder (can grow in 2 directions)
_ Hidden Leaf nodes can also be considered to be part of the occluder
_ In 3D, can extend in 3 directions and an octree is used. ITCS 4010/5010:Game Engine Design 49 Spatial Structures/ Acceleration Algorithms
Hardware Occlusion Queries
_ HP Visualize FX Graphics:
_ Supports occlusion queries, compares a set of polygons to current
Z-buffer contents.
_ Typically bounding volume polygons used.
_ Performance: 25 to 100 percent, long latency.
_ NVIDIA:
_ NV query, returns the number of pixels that pass the depth test
_ Cull object if n = 0, or n > thresh (speed/quality tradeoff) or
use to determine LOD.
_ Can test if the result is back, else return control to application,
and allows multiple queries in parallel.
_ Bounding volumes and hierarchies can be used to further optimally
use the hardware queries (see text).

Hierarchical Z-Buffering (Greene 93, 95)
_ Signficance influence on occlusion culling research
_ Potential for hardware implementation, real-time applications.
_ Scene model in an octree, frame’s Z-buffer is a pyramid
_ Octree enables object-space culling, while Z-buffer pyramid enables
hierarchical Z-buffering of primitves, bounding volumes
_ Z-Pyramid is the occlusion representation.

Hierarchical Z-Buffering (HZB) Algorithm
_ Z-Pyramid Construction: Finest level is the standard Z-buffer, all
other levels - Z value is the farthest of the 2 × 2 window of adjacent
finer level.
_ If a Z value is overwritten, the coarser levels are updated in sequence.
_ Hierarchical Culling:
_ BB of octree (screen projected) is tested against the coarsest
level
_ If face’s nearest depth (znear) is farther, the face is culled, else
continue down the Z-pyramid
_ If bottom level of Z-pyramid reached, and octree box is visible,
testing continues down the octree.
