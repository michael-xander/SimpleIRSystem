Given the direction to the light source and the direction to the viewer, and the surface normal (which we can
compute because we know the object that the ray struck), we have all the information that we need to compute
the reflected intensity of the light at this point, say, by using the Phong model and information about the ambient,
diffuse, and specular reflection properties of the object. We use this model to assign a color to the pixel. We
simply repeat this operation on all the pixels in the grid, and we have our final image.
Even this simple ray tracing model is already better than what OpenGL supports, because, for example, OpenGL’s
local lighting model does not compute shadows. The ray tracing model can easily be extended to deal with reflective
objects (such as mirrors and shiny spheres) and transparent objects (glass balls and rain drops). For
example, when the ray hits a reflective object, we compute the reflection ray and shoot it into the environment.
We invoke the ray tracing algorithm recursively. When we get the associated color, we blend it with the local
surface color and return the result. The generic algorithm is outlined below.
rayTrace(): Given the camera setup and the image size, generate a ray Rij from the eye passing through the
center of each pixel (i; j) of your image window (See Fig. 56.) Call trace(R) and assign the color returned
to this pixel.
trace(R): Shoot R into the scene and let X be the first object hit and P be the point of contact with this object.
(a) If X is reflective, then compute the reflection ray Rr of R at P. Let Cr   trace(Rr).
(b) If X is transparent, then compute the transmission (refraction) ray Rt of R at P. Let Ct   trace(Rt).
(c) For each light source L,
(i) Shoot a ray RL from P to L.
(ii) If RL does not hit any object until reaching L, then apply the lighting model to determine the
shading at this point.
(d) Combine the colors Cr and Ct due to reflection and transmission (if any) along with the combined
shading from (c) to determine the final color C. Return C.
There are two questions to be considered. How to determine what object the ray intersects (which we will
consider next time) and how to use this information to determine the reflected color? We will concentrate on
this latter item today.

Reflection: Recall the Phong reflection model. Each object is associated with a color, and its coefficients of ambient,
diffuse, and specular reflection, denoted a, d and s. To model the reflective component, each object will
be associated with an additional parameter called the coefficient of reflection, denoted r. As with the other
coefficients this is a number in the interval [0; 1]. Let us assume that this coefficient is nonzero. We compute the
view reflection ray (which equalizes the angle between the surface normal and the view vector). Let ~v denote
the normalized view vector, which points backwards along the viewing ray. Thus, if you ray is P + t~u, then
~v = -normalize(~u). (This is essentially the same as the view vector used in the Phong model, but it may not
point directly back to the eye because of intermediate reflections.) Let ~n denote the outward pointing surface
normal vector, which we assume is also normalized. The normalized view reflection vector, denoted ~rv was
derived earlier this semester:
~rv = 2(~n ~v)~n-~v:
v rv

Fig. 57: Reflection.
Next we shoot the ray emanating from the surface contact point along this direction and apply the above raytracing
algorithm recursively. Eventually, when the ray hits a nonreflective object, the resulting color is returned.
This color is then factored into the Phong model, as will be described below. Note that it is possible for this
process to go into an infinite loop, if say you have two mirrors facing each other. To avoid such looping, it is
common to have a maximum recursion depth, after which some default color is returned, irrespective of whether
the object is reflective.
Transparent objects and refraction: To model refraction, also called transmission, we maintain a coefficient of
transmission, denoted t. We also need to associate each surface with two additional parameters, the indices of
refraction4 for the incident side i and the transmitted side, t. Recall from physics that the index of refraction
is the ratio of the speed of light through a vacuum versus the speed of light through the material. Typical indices
of refraction include:
Material Index of Refraction
Air (vacuum) 1.0
Water 1.333
Glass 1.5
Diamond 2.47
Snell’s law says that if a ray is incident with angle i (relative to the surface normal) then it will transmitted with
angle t (relative to the opposite normal) such that
sin i
sin t
= t
i
:
Let us work out the direction of the transmitted ray from this. As before let ~v denote the normalized view vector,
directed back along the incident ray. Let~t denote the unit vector along the transmitted direction, which we wish
to compute. The orthogonal projection of ~v onto the normalized normal vector ~n is
~mi = (~v  ~n)~n = (cos i)~n:
4To be completely accurate, the index of refraction depends on the wavelength of light being transmitted. This is what causes white light to be
spread into a spectrum as it passes through a prism. But since we do not model light as an entire spectrum, but only through a triple of RGB values
(which produce the same color visually, but not the same spectrum physically) we will not get realistic results. For simplicity we assume that all
wavelengths have the same index of refraction.
