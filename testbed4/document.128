Animation
16.1 Overview
Motion can bring the simplest of characters to life. Even simple polygonal shapes can convey a number of human qualities when animated: identity, character, gender, mood, intention, emotion, and so on.

A movie is a sequence of frames of still images. For video, the frame rate is typically 24 frames per second. For ?lm, this is 30 frames per second.

CSC418 / CSCD18 / CSC2504 Animation
In general, animation may be achieved by specifying a model with n parameters that identify degrees of freedom that an animator may be interested in such as • polygon vertices, • spline control, • joint angles, • muscle contraction, • camera parameters, or • color. With n parameters, this results in a vector ~q in n-dimensional state space. Parameters may be varied to generate animation. A model's motion is a trajectory through its state space or a set of motion curves for each parameter over time, i.e. ~q(t), where t is the time of the current frame. Every animation technique reduces to specifying the state space trajectory.
The basic animation algorithm is then: for t=t1 to tend: render(~ q(t)).
Modeling and animation are loosely coupled. Modeling describes control values and their actions. Animation describes how to vary the control values. There are a number of animation techniques, including the following: • User driven animation - Keyframing
- Motion capture • Procedural animation - Physical simulation
- Particle systems
- Crowd behaviors • Data-driven animation
