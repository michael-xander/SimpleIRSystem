This paper introduces the concept of Geometry Compression, allowing
3D triangle data to be represented with a factor of 6 to 10
times fewer bits than conventional techniques, with only slight losses
in object quality. The technique is amenable to rapid decompression
in both software and hardware implementations; if 3D rendering
hardware contains a geometry decompression unit, application
geometry can be stored in memory in compressed format. Geometry
is first represented as a generalized triangle mesh, a data structure
that allows each instance of a vertex in a linear stream to specify
an average of two triangles. Then a variable length compression
is applied to individual positions, colors, and normals. Delta compression
followed by a modified Huffman compression is used for
positions and colors; a novel table-based approach is used for normals.
The table allows any useful normal to be represented by an
18-bit index, many normals can be represented with index deltas of
8 bits or less. Geometry compression is a general space-time tradeoff,
and offers advantages at every level of the memory/interconnect
hierarchy: less storage space is needed on disk, less transmission
time is needed on networks.

1 INTRODUCTION
Modern 3D computer graphics makes extensive use of geometry to
describe 3D objects. Many graphics techniques are available for such
use. Complex smooth surfaces can be succinctly represented by high
level abstractions such as trimmed NURBS. Detailed surface geometry
can many times be rendered by use of texture maps. But as realism
is added, more and more raw geometry is required, usually in the
form of triangles. Position, color, and normal components of these
triangles are typically represented as floating point numbers; an isolated
triangle can take on the order of 100 bytes or more of storage to
describe. To maximize detail while minimizing the number of triangles,
triangle re-tessellation techniques can be employed. The techniques
described in the current paper are complementary: for a fixed
number of triangles, minimize the total bit-size of the representation,
subject to quality (and implementation) trade-offs.
While many techniques exist for (lossy and lossless) compression of
2D pixel images, and at least one exists for 2D geometry [2], no corresponding
techniques have previously been available for compression
of 3D triangles. This paper describes a viable algorithm for Geometry
Compression, which furthermore is suitable for implementation
in real-time hardware. The availability of a decompression unit
within rendering hardware means that geometry can be stored and
transmitted entirely in compressed format. This addresses one of the
main bottlenecks in current graphics accelerators: input bandwidth.
It also greatly increases the amount of geometry that can be cached
in main memory. In distributed networked applications, compression
can help make shared VR display environments feasible, by greatly
reducing transmission time. Even low-end video games are going
true 3D with a vengeance, but without compression even CD-ROMs
are limited to a few tens of millions of triangles total storage.
The technique described here can achieve (lossy) compression ratios
of between 6 and 10 to 1, depending on the original representation
format and the final quality level desired. The compression
proceeds in four stages. The first is the conversion of triangle data
into a generalized triangle mesh form. The second is the quantization
of individual positions, colors, and normals. Quantization of
normals includes a novel translation to non-rectilinear representation.
In the third stage the quantized values are delta encoded between
neighbors. The final stage performs a Huffman tag-based
variable-length encoding of these deltas. Decompression is the reverse
of this process; the decompressed stream of triangle data is
then passed to a traditional rendering pipeline, where it is processed
in full floating point accuracy.
2 REPRESENTATION OF GEOMETRY
Today, most major MCAD and many animation modeling packages
allow the use of CSG (constructive solid geometry) and free-form
NURBS in the construction and representation of geometry. The resulting
trimmed polynomial surfaces are a high-level representation
of regions of smooth surfaces. However for hardware rendering,
these surfaces are typically pre-tessellated in software into triangles
prior to transmission to the rendering hardware, even on hardware
that supports some form of hardware NURBS rendering. Furthermore,
much of the advantage of the NURBS representation of geometry
is for tasks other than real-time rendering. These non-ren-
