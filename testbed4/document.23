The objective function is defined such that its
minimization drives the mesh vertices to locations that
improve the mesh, with respect to some quality measure.
If this objective function is minimized directly, with respect
to the real coordinates of the vertices, the search
direction for the minimization may indicate vertex
movement off the original surface mesh. To constrain
the movement of the vertices to the discrete surface, the
optimization must be performed with respect to the
coordinates of the vertices in a 2D parametric space
corresponding to the surface mesh. Assuming that there
is no smooth surface underlying the discrete surface, one
of several methods can be used to derive such a global
parametric space from the surface mesh [11–15]. However,
most of these methods involve substantial cost

since they require the solution of a large system of
equations that may be nonlinear.
In this work, instead of using a global parametric
space derived from the entire mesh, nodes are repositioned
in a series of local parametric spaces. The local
parametric spaces are derived from a mapping of mesh
edges and triangular facets of mesh faces to canonical
elements in 2D space, as is commonly done in finite
element methods [16, 17]. Vertices on the boundary of
the surface mesh (i.e., on a model edge) move in parametric
spaces of boundary edges of the original mesh.
The parametric space of each boundary mesh edge is
derived by mapping it to a unit line segment along the
x-axis, giving rise to parametric coordinate 0 £ s0 £ 1.
Vertices in the interior of the surface mesh (i.e., on a
model face) move in parametric spaces derived from
faces of the original mesh. The parametric space for a
mesh triangle is derived using a barycentric mapping
[17], resulting in parametric coordinates 0 £ (s1, s2) £
1 (Fig. 1a). Quadrilaterals and more general polygons
are considered to be made up of triangular facets
(Fig. 1b) and a parametric space is derived for each facet
as before. The facetization of polygons is computed by
choosing a central point and connecting it to the polygon
edges. To choose the central point, a full quadric
