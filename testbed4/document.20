Culling: Before performing a general hidden surface removal algorithm, it is common to first apply heuristics to
remove objects that are obviously not visible. This process is called culling. There are three common forms of
culling.
Back-face Culling: This is a simple trick, which can eliminate roughly half of the faces from consideration.
Assuming that the viewer is never inside any of the objects of the scene, then the back sides of objects are
never visible to the viewer, and hence they can be eliminated from consideration.
For each polygonal face, we assume an outward pointing normal has been computed. If this normal is
directed away from the viewpoint, that is, if its dot product with a vector directed towards the viewer is
negative, then the face can be immediately discarded from consideration. (See Fig. 91.)
View Frustum Culling: If a polygon does not lie within the view frustum (recall from the lecture on perspective),
that is, the region that is visible to the viewer, then it does not need to be rendered. This automatically
eliminates polygons that lie behind the viewer. (See Fig. 91.)
This amounts to clipping a 2-dimensional polygon against a 3-dimensional frustum. The Liang-Barsky
clipping algorithm can be generalized to do this.
Sometimes a polygon can be culled because it is “known” that the polygon cannot be visible,
based on knowledge of the domain. For example, if you are rendering a room of a building, then it is
reasonable to infer that furniture on other floors or in distant rooms on the same floor are not visible. This
is the hardest type of culling, because it relies on knowledge of the environment. This information is
typically precomputed, based on expert knowledge or complex analysis of the environment.
Depth-Sort Algorithm: A fairly simple hidden-surface algorithm is based on the principle of painting objects from
back to front, so that more distant polygons are overwritten by closer polygons. This is called the depthsort
algorithm. This suggests the following algorithm: sort all the polygons according to increasing distance
from the viewpoint, and then scan convert them in reverse order (back to front). This is sometimes called the
painter’s algorithm because it mimics the way that oil painters usually work (painting the background before
the foreground). The painting process involves setting pixels, so the algorithm is an image precision algorithm.
There is a very quick-and-dirty technique for sorting polygons, which unfortunately does not generally work.
Compute a representative point on each polygon (e.g. the centroid or the farthest point to the viewer). Sort the
objects by decreasing order of distance from the viewer to the representative point (or using the pseudodepth
which we discussed in discussing perspective) and draw the polygons in this order. Unfortunately, just because
the representative points are ordered, it does not imply that the entire polygons are ordered. Worse yet, it may
be impossible to order polygons so that this type of algorithm will work. The Fig. 92 shows such an example, in
which the polygons overlap one another cyclically.
