We will now take a look at the next major element of graphics rendering: light and shading.
This is one of the primary elements of generating realistic images. This topic is the beginning of an important
shift in approach. Up until now, we have discussed graphics from are purely mathematical (geometric) perspective.
Light and reflection brings us to issues involved with the physics of light and color and the physiological
aspects of how humans perceive light and color.
An accurate simulation of light energy and how it emanates, reflects off and passes through objects is an amazingly
complex, and computationally intractable task. OpenGL, like most interactive graphics systems, supports
a very simple lighting and shading model, and hence can achieve only limited realism. This was done primarily
because speed is of the essence in interactive graphics. OpenGL assumes a local illumination model, which
means that the shading of a point depends only on its relationship to the light sources, without considering the
other objects in the scene. For example, OpenGL’s lighting model does not model shadows, it does not handle
indirect reflection from other objects (where light bounces off of one object and illuminates another), it does not
handle objects that reflect or refract light (like metal spheres and glass balls). However the designers of OpenGL
have included a number of tricks for essentially “faking” many of these effects.
OpenGL’s light and shading model was designed to be very efficient and very general (in order to permit the
faking alluded to earlier). It contains a number features that seem to bear little or no resemblance to the laws of
physics. The lighting model that we will is slightly different from OpenGL’s model, but is a bit more meaningful
from the perspective of physics.
Light: A detailed discussion of light and its properties would take us more deeply into physics than we care to
go. For our purposes, we can imagine a simple model of light consisting of a large number of photons being
emitted continuously from each light source. Each photon has an associated color. Although color is complex
phenomenon, for our purposes it is sufficient to consider color to be a modeled as a triple of red, green, and
blue components. (We will consider color later this semester.) The strength or intensity of the light time at any
location can be defined of in terms of the number of photons passing through a fixed area over a fixed amount
of time. Assuming that the atmosphere is a vacuum (in particular there is no smoke or fog), photons travel
unimpeded until hitting a surface, after which one of three things can happen.
Reflection: The photon can be reflected or scattered back into the atmosphere. If the surface were perfectly
smooth (like a mirror or highly polished metal) the refection would satisfy the rule “angle of incidence

equals angle of reflection” and the result would be a mirror-like and very shiny in appearance. On the
other hand, if the surface is rough at a microscopic level (like foam rubber, say) then the photons are
scattered nearly uniformly in all directions. We can further distinguish different varieties of reflection:
Pure reflection: perfect mirror-like reflectors
Specular reflection: imperfect reflectors like brushed metal and shiny plastics.
Diffuse reflection: uniformly scattering, and hence not shiny.
Absorption: The photon can be absorbed into the surface (and hence dissipates in the form of heat energy).
We do not see this light. Thus, an object appears to be green, because it reflects photons in the green part
of the spectrum and absorbs photons in the other regions of the visible spectrum.
Transmission: The photon can pass through the surface. This happens perfectly with transparent objects (like
glass and polished gem stones) and with a significant amount of scattering with translucent objects (like
human skin or a thin piece of tissue paper).

Fig. 43: The ways in which a photon of light can interact with a surface point.
Of course real surfaces possess various combinations of these elements and these element can interact in complex
ways. For example, human skin is characterized by a complex phenomenon called subsurface scattering,
in which light is transmitted under the skin and then bounces around and is reflected at some other point.
What we “see” is a function of the photons that enter our eye. Photons leave the light source, are reflected and
transmitted in various ways in the environment, they bounce off various surfaces, and then they finally enter our
eye and we perceive the resulting color. The more accurately we can simulate this physical process, the more
realistic the lighting will be. Unfortunately, computers are not fast enough to produce a truly realistic simulation
of indirect reflections in real time, and so we will have to settle for much simpler approximations.
