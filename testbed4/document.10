The next issue needed to determine how objects appear is how this light is reflected off of
the objects in the scene and reach the viewer. So the discussion shifts from the discussion of light sources to
the discussion of object surface properties. We will assume that all objects are opaque. The simple model that
we will use for describing the reflectance properties of objects is called the Phong model. The model is over 20
years old, and is based on modeling surface reflection as a combination of the following components:
Emission: This is used to model objects that glow (even when all the lights are off). This is unaffected by the
presence of any light sources. However, because our illumination model is local, it does not behave like a
light source, in the sense that it does not cause any other objects to be illuminated.
Ambient reflection: This is a simple way to model indirect reflection. All surfaces in all positions and orientations
are illuminated equally by this light energy.
Diffuse reflection: The illumination produced by matte (i.e, dull or nonshiny) smooth objects, such as foam
rubber.

Specular reflection: The bright spots appearing on smooth shiny (e.g. metallic or polished) surfaces. Although
specular reflection is related to pure reflection (as with mirrors), for the purposes of our simple model these
two are different. In particular, specular reflection only reflects light, not the surrounding objects in the
scene.
Let L = (Lr; Lg; Lb) denote the illumination intensity of the light source. OpenGL allows us to break this
light’s emitted intensity into three components: ambient La, diffuse Ld, and specular Ls. Each type of light
component consists of the three color components, so, for example, Ld = (Ldr; Ldg; Ldb), denotes the RGB
vector (or more generally the RGBA components) of the diffuse component of light. As we have seen, modeling
the ambient component separately is merely a convenience for modeling indirect reflection. It is not as clear why
someone would want to turn on or turn off a light source’s ability to generate diffuse and specular reflection.
(There is no physical justification to this that I know of. It is an object’s surface properties, not the light’s
properties, which determine whether light reflects diffusely or specularly. But, again this is all just a model.)
The diffuse and specular intensities of a light source are usually set equal to each other.
An object’s color determines how much of a given intensity is reflected. Let C = (Cr; Cg; Cb) denote the
object’s color. These are assumed to be normalized to the interval [0; 1]. Thus we can think of Cr as the fraction
of red light that is reflected from an object. Thus, if Cr = 0, then no red light is reflected. When light of
intensity L hits an object of color C, the amount of reflected light is given by the product
LC = (LrCr; LgCg; LbCb):
Beware: This is a component-by-component multiplication, and not a vector multiplication or dot-product in
the usual sense. For example, if the light is white L = (1;1;1) and the color is red C = (1;0;0) then the
reflection is LC = (1;0; 0) which is red. However if the light is blue L = (0;0; 1), then there is no reflection,
LC = (0;0; 0), and hence the object appears to be black.
In OpenGL rather than specifying a single color for an object (which indicates how much light is reflected for
each component) you instead specify the amount of reflection for each type of illumination: Ca, Cd, and Cs.
Each of these is an RGBA vector. This seems to be a rather extreme bit of generality, because, for example, it
allows you to specify that an object can reflect only red light ambient light and only blue diffuse light. Again, I
know of no physical explanation for this phenomenon. Note that it is common that the specular color (since it
arises by way of reflection of the light source) is usually made the same color as the light source, not the object.
In our presentation, we will assume that Ca = Cd = C, the color of the object, and that Cs = L, the color of
the light source.
So far we have laid down the foundation for the Phong Model. Next time we will discuss exactly how the Phong
model assigns colors to the points of a scene.
The Relevant Vectors: The shading of a point on a surface is a function of the relationship between the viewer, light
sources, and surface. (Recall that because this is a local illumination model the other objects of the scene are
ignored.) The following vectors are relevant to shading. We can think of them as being centered on the point
whose shading we wish to compute. For the purposes of our equations below, it will be convenient to think of
them all as being of unit length. They are illustrated in Fig. 46.

Normal vector: A vector ~n that is perpendicular to the surface and directed outwards from the surface. There
are a number of ways to compute normal vectors, depending on the representation of the underlying object.
For our purposes, the following simple method is sufficient. Given any three noncollinear points,
P0; P1; P2, on a polygon, we can compute a normal to the surface of the polygon as a cross product of two
of the associated vectors.
~n = normalize((P1 - P0)  (P2 - P0)):
The vector will be directed outwards if the triple P0P1P2 has a counterclockwise orientation when seen
from outside.
View vector: A vector ~v that points in the direction of the viewer (or camera).
Light vector: A vector~`
that points towards the light source.
Reflection vector: A vector ~r that indicates the direction of pure reflection of the light vector. (Based on the
law that the angle of incidence with respect to the surface normal equals the angle of reflection.) The
reflection vector computation reduces to an easy exercise in vector arithmetic. First observe that (because
all vectors have been normalized to unit length) the orthogonal projection of~`
onto ~n is
~n
0 = (~n ~`
)~n:
The vector directed from the tip of~`
to the tip of ~n0 is ~u = ~n0 -~`
. To get ~r observe that we need add two
copies of ~u to~`
. Thus we have
~r = ~`
+ 2~u = ~`
+ 2(~n
0 -~`
) = 2(~n ~`
)~n-~`:
Halfway vector: A vector ~h that is midway between ~`
and ~v. Since this is half way between ~`
and ~v, and
both have been normalized to unit length, we can compute this by simply averaging these two vectors and
normalizing (assuming that they are not pointing in exactly opposite directions). Since we are normalizing,
the division by 2 for averaging is not needed.
~h = normalize((~`
+~v)=2) = normalize(~`
+~v):
Phong Lighting Equations: There almost no objects that are pure diffuse reflectors or pure specular reflectors. The
Phong reflection model is based on the simple modeling assumption that we can model any (nontextured) object’s
surface to a reasonable extent as some mixture of purely diffuse and purely specular components of
reflection along with emission and ambient reflection. Let us ignore emission for now, since it is the rarest of
the group, and will be easy to add in at the end of the process.
The surface material properties of each object will be specified
