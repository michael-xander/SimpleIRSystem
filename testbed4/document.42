 And of course the second problem is how fast you can draw the line. That is the most important part where we need the computer scientist and the computer science based students will be very happy to come up with a algorithm where we were in need of processing things very fast, come up with optimal algorithm followed to solve that. But we are still in the environment where we substitute the value of m into mx plus b, m is the floating point number, x and b could be integers, so the resultant value is the floating point number used on operation to calculate the y and x, y integer value is u select. 
Let us see with the example which we have just solved now. This was the example we just solved now, the starting point was obtained as 1, 2, the finishing point of the line was 5, 4 the rest of the values in between where obtained using round functions. So these are the examples which we just solved about one or two slides back. And why the round function is important I did say that, that is probably the closest integer pixel which you get. 
If you do not use round function then what will you use? Of course you cannot get a pixel at the fractional numbers which are put on the right hand side that is 8 by 5, 11 by 5, 14 by 5, 17 by 5 these are all floating point numbers. There are no addressable pixels available at any arbitrary floating point numbers. So you will say instead of rounding I will choose the next highest number or the next lowest number. If you choose the next highest number let us see what happens. If you choose the next highest number which is starting from 0, 1 and then 1, 2 that is the next highest instead of element by 5 the next highest number will be 2, 3 or 3, 3 of course the next highest then you get 4, 4 and 5. 
(Refer Slide Time: 28:54) 
You can see these are the next highest. Instead of using the round function what has been done here is you have chosen the next highest integers with respect to the values given on the right hand side. The next highest of 8 by 5 is 2. So you have 1, 2 the next highest of 11, 5 is 3. So you have 2, 3 instead of 2, 2 and 14 by 5 the next highest gives you 3 that is fine. But in 17 by 5 the next highest is 4. So these are the pixels which you will get if you chose the next highest you can visualize yourself that if you choose the next lowest instead you can just almost get the mirror image of what are the pixels which we have just seen on the screen. And as you can see on the screen the pixels which you have seen they are all on one side of the line and that is not what we are looking for, the line will appear to be shifted away little bit only the starting and ending point will be same and all the pixels appear to be outside. 
If you use the round function what happens, this is now the figure which we see here instead of next highest, if we use the round functions and we already have used it and obtained the integer coordinates of x and y as 1, 2 2, 2 3, 3 4, 3 and 5, 4 and they have been drawn on the screen starting from 0, 1. The starting point to 5, 4 1, 2 of course is the next addressable point. Then 2, 2 here 3, 3 here 4, 3 here 5, 4 is the last finishing point. 
Now you can see there is a lot of balance, there are few pixels on the top of the line, some on and some at the bottom of the line. This is what is going to happen and you will have a uniform split of a view point on both sides of the line and typically this is scenario which you will get a numerical company exercise of what is called as least square equation of a line where these points are given you need to find the equation of a line. But that is a different problem altogether and in this case of computer graphics you are expected to find out those points which are distributed over the line and the most closest. That one is most important that you need to find out the point which is the most closest and these are the points which are the closest by using the round function.
