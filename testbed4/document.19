Let us consider how to generalize Bresenham’s midpoint line drawing algorithm for the
rasterization of a circle. We will make a number of assumptions to simplify the presentation of the algorithm.
First, let us assume that the circle is centered at the origin. (If not, then the initial conditions to the following
algorithm are changed slightly.) Let R denote the (integer) radius of the circle.
The first observations about circles is that it suffices to consider how to draw the arc in the positive quadrant
from _=4 to _=2, since all the other points on the circle can be determined from these by 8-way symmetry.

What are the comparable elements of Bresenham’s midpoint algorithm for circles? As before, we need an
implicit representation of the function. For this we use
F(x; y) = x2 +y2 -R2 = 0:
Note that for points inside the circle (or under the arc) this expression is negative, and for points outside the
circle (or above the arc) it is positive.

Let’s assume that we have just finished drawing pixel (xp; yp), and we want to select the next pixel to draw
(drawing clockwise around the boundary). Since the slope of the circular arc is between 0 and -1, our choice

at each step our choice is between the neighbor to the east E and the neighbor to the southeast SE. If the circle
passes above the midpoint M between these pixels, then we go to E next, otherwise we go to SE.
Next, we need a decision variable. We take this to be the value of F(M), which is
D = F(M) = F(xp + 1; yp - 1

)
= (xp+ 1)2 + (yp - 1

)2 -R2:
IfD < 0 then M is below the arc, and so the E pixel is closer to the line. On the other hand, if D _ 0 then M
is above the arc, so the SE pixel is closer to the line.
Again, the new value of D will depend on our choice.
We go to E next: Then the next midpoint will have coordinates (xp+2; yp-(1=2)) and hence the new d value
This is something of a pain, because we have been trying to avoid floating point arithmetic. However, there is a
very clever observation that can be made at this point. We are only interested in testing whether D is positive or
negative. Whenever we change the value of D, we do so by a integer increment. Thus, D is always of the form
D0 + 1=4, where D0 is an integer. Such a quantity is positive if and only if D0 is positive. Therefore, we can
just ignore this extra 1=4 term. So, we initialize Dinit = 1-R(subtracting off exactly 1=4), and the algorithm
behaves exactly as it would otherwise!
