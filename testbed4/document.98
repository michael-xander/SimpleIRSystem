Basic Line Drawing
Set the color of pixels to approximate the appearance of a line from (x0,y0) to (x1,y1). It should be • "straight" and pass through the end points. • independent of point order. • uniformly bright, independent of slope.
The explicit equation for a line is y = mx + b.
Note: Given two points (x0,y0) and (x1,y1) that lie on a line, we can solve for m and b for the line. Consider y0 = mx0 + b and y1 = mx1 + b. Subtract y0 from y1 to solve for m = y1-y0 x1-x0 and b = y0 -mx0. Substituting in the value for b, this equation can be written as y = m(x-x0) + y0. Consider this simple line drawing algorithm:
int x float m, y m = (y1 - y0) / (x1 - x0) for (x = x0; x <= x1; ++x) { y = m * (x - x0) + y0 setpixel(x, round(y), linecolor) }

CSC418 / CSCD18 / CSC2504 Introduction to Graphics
Problems with this algorithm: • If x1 < x0 nothing is drawn. Solution: Switch the order of the points if x1 < x0. • Consider the cases when m < 1 and m > 1:
(a) m < 1 (b) m > 1
A different number of pixels are on, which implies different brightness between the two. Solution: When m > 1, loop over y = y0 ...y1 instead of x, then x = 1 m(y-y0) + x0. • Inef?cient because of the number of operations and the use of ?oating point numbers. Solution: A more advanced algorithm, called Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm.

2 Curves
2.1 Parametric Curves
There are multiple ways to represent curves in two dimensions: • Explicit: y = f(x), given x, ?nd y. Example: The explicit form of a line is y = mx + b. There is a problem with this representation-what about vertical lines?
• Implicit: f(x,y) = 0, or in vector form, f(¯ p) = 0. Example: The implicit equation of a line through ¯ p0 and ¯ p1 is (x-x0)(y1 -y0)-(y-y0)(x1 -x0) = 0. Intuition: - The direction of the line is the vector ~ d = ¯ p1 - ¯ p0. - So a vector from ¯ p0 to any point on the line must be parallel to ~ d. - Equivalently, any point on the line must have direction from ¯ p0 perpendicular to ~ d? = (dy,-dx) =~n. This can be checked with ~ d· ~ d? = (dx,dy)·(dy,-dx) = 0. - So for any point ¯ p on the line, (¯ p- ¯ p0)·~n = 0. Here ~n = (y1 -y0,x0 -x1). This is called a normal. - Finally, (¯ p- ¯ p0)·~n = (x-x0,y-y0)·(y1-y0,x0-x1) = 0. Hence, the line can also be written as:
(¯ p- ¯ p0)·~n = 0
Example: The implicit equation for a circle of radius r and center ¯ pc = (xc,yc) is (x-xc)2 + (y-yc)2 = r2, or in vector form, k¯ p- ¯ pck2 = r2.

• Parametric: ¯ p = ¯ f(?) where ¯ f : R ? R2, may be written as ¯ p(?) or (x(?),y(?)). Example: A parametric line through ¯ p0 and ¯ p1 is
¯ p(?) = ¯ p0 + ?~ d,
where ~ d = ¯ p1 - ¯ p0. Note that bounds on ? must be speci?ed: - Line segment from ¯ p0 to ¯ p1: 0 = ? = 1. - Ray from ¯ p0 in the direction of ¯ p1: 0 = ? < 8. - Line passing through ¯ p0 and ¯ p1: -8 < ? < 8
Example: What's the perpendicular bisector of the line segment between ¯ p0 and ¯ p1?
- The midpoint is ¯ p(?) where ? = 1 2, that is, ¯ p0 + 1 2
~ d = ¯ p0+¯ p1 2 .
- The line perpendicular to ¯ p(?) has direction parallel to the normal of ¯ p(?), which is ~n = (y1 -y0,-(x1 -x0)). Hence, the perpendicular bisector is the line l(a) =¯ p0 + 1 2 ~ d+ a~n. Example: Find the intersection of the lines ¯ l(?) = ¯ p0 + ?~ d0 and f(¯ p) = (¯ p- ¯ p1)·~n1 = 0. Substitute ¯ l(?) into the implicit equation f(¯ p) to see what value of ? satis?es it: f¯ l(?) = ¯ p0 + ?~ d0 - ¯ p1·~n1= ?~ d0 ·~n1 -(¯ p1 - ¯ p0)·~n1 = 0
Therefore, if ~ d0 ·~n1 6= 0,
?* =
(¯ p1 - ¯ p0)·~n1 ~ d0 ·~n1
,
and the intersection point is ¯ l(?*). If ~ d0 ·~n1 = 0, then the two lines are parallel with no intersection or they are the same line.

Example: The parametric form of a circle with radius r for 0 = ? < 1 is ¯ p(?) = (rcos(2p?),rsin(2p?)).
This is the polar coordinate representation of a circle. There are an in?nite number of parametric representations of most curves, such as circles. Can you think of others?
An important property of parametric curves is that it is easy to generate points along a curve by evaluating ¯ p(?) at a sequence of ? values.
2.1.1 Tangents and Normals
The tangent to a curve at a point is the instantaneous direction of the curve. The line containing the tangent intersects the curve at a point. It is given by the derivative of the parametric form ¯ p(?) with regard to ?. That is,
~t(?) =
d¯ p(?) d?
=dx(?) d?
,
dy(?) d? .
The normal is perpendicular to the tangent direction. Often we normalize the normal to have unit length. For closed curves we often talk about an inward-facing and an outward-facing normal. When the type is unspeci?ed, we are usually dealing with an outward-facing normal.

We can also derive the normal from the implicit form. The normal at a point ¯ p = (x,y) on a curve de?ned by f(¯ p) = f(x,y) = 0 is:
~n(¯ p) = ?f(¯ p)|¯ p =?f(x,y) ?x
,
?f(x,y) ?y 
Derivation: For any curve in implicit form, there also exists a parametric representation ¯ p(?) =

(x(?),y(?)). All points on the curve must satisfy f(¯ p) = 0. Therefore, for any choice of ?, we have: 0 = f(x(?),y(?))
We can differentiate both side with respect to ?:
0 =
d d?
f(x(?),y(?)) (1)
0 =
?f ?x

?f ?y
dy(?) d?

0 = ?f ?x

?f ?y·dx(?) d?
,
dy(?) d?  (3)
0 = ?f(¯ p)|¯ p ·~t(?) (4) This last line states that the gradient is perpendicular to the curve tangent, which is the de?nition of the normal vector.
Example: The implicit form of a circle at the origin is: f(x,y) = x2+y2-R2 = 0. The normal at a point (x,y) on the circle is: ?f = (2x,2y). Exercise: show that the normal computed for a line is the same, regardless of whether it is computed using the parametric or implicit forms. Try it for another surface.
2.2 Ellipses • Implicit: x2 a2 + y2 b2 = 1. This is only for the special case where the ellipse is centered at the origin with the major and minor axes aligned with y = 0 and x = 0.

b
• Parametric: x(?) = acos(2p?), y(?) = bsin(2p?), or in vector form
¯ p(?) = acos(2p?) bsin(2p?) .

The implicit form of ellipses and circles is common because there is no explicit functional form. This is because y is a multifunction of x.
2.3 Polygons
A polygon is a continuous, piecewise linear, closed planar curve. • A simple polygon is non self-intersecting. • A regular polygon is simple, equilateral, and equiangular. • An n-gon is a regular polygon with n sides. • A polygon is convex if, for any two points selected inside the polygon, the line segment between them is completely contained within the polygon.
Example: To ?nd the vertices of an n-gon, ?nd n equally spaced points on a circle.
r
?
In polar coordinates, each vertex (xi,yi) = (rcos(?i),rsin(?i)), where ?i = i2p n for i = 0...n-1. • To translate: Add (xc,yc) to each point. • To scale: Change r. • To rotate: Add ?? to each ?i.
2.4 Rendering Curves in OpenGL
OpenGL does not directly support rendering any curves other that lines and polylines. However, you can sample a curve and draw it as a line strip, e.g.,:
float x, y; glBegin(GL_LINE_STRIP); for (int t=0 ; t <= 1 ; t += .01)
