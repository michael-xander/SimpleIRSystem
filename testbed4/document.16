Next, we present an intersection algorithm for a ray and a convex polyhedron. The
convex polyhedron is defined as the intersection of a collection of halfspaces in 3-space. Recall that a halfspace
is the set of points lying to one side of a plane. The problem of intersecting a ray with a plane is a special case
of this. (This algorithm is a variation of the Liang-Barsky line segment clipping algorithm, which is used for
clipping line segments against the 3-dimensional view volume, which was introduced when we were discussing
perspective.)
As before, we represent the ray parametrically as P +t~u, for scalar t > 0. Let H1;H2; : : : ; Hk denote the halfspaces
defining the polyhedron. Each halfspace H is represented by a 4-dimensional homogeneous coordinate
vector H : (a; b; c; d). It represents the set of points P = (px; py; pz)T satisfying the equation:
apx + bpy + cpz + d  0
Observe that if P is expressed in homogenous coordinates P = (px; py; pz; 1)T , then this can be written more
succinctly as the dot product (H  P)  0. We can think of a plane the special case of the boundary of a
polyhedron defined by a single halfspace. In such a case the outward pointing normal is ~no = normalize(a; b; c)
and the inward pointing normal is ~ni = normalize(-a;-b;-c). We will compute the intersection of the ray
with each halfspace in turn. The final result will be the intersection of the ray with the entire polyhedron.
An important property of convex bodies (of any variety) is that a line intersects a convex body in at most one
line segment. Thus the intersection of the ray with the polyhedron can be specified entirely by an interval of
scalars [t0; t1], such that the intersection is defined by the set of points
P + t~u for t0  t  t1.
Initially, let this interval be [0;1]. (For line segment intersection the only change is that the initial value of t1
is set so that we end and the endpoint of the segment. Otherwise the algorithm is identical.)
Suppose that we have already performed the intersection with some number of the halfspaces. It might be that
the intersection is already empty. This will be reflected by the fact that t0 > t1 . When this is so, we may
terminate the algorithm at any time. Otherwise, let H = (a; b; c; d) be the coefficients of the current halfspace.
We want to know the value of t (if any) at which the ray intersects the plane. Plugging in the representation of
the ray into the halfspace inequality we have
a(px + t~ux) + b(py +t~uy) + c(pz +t~uz) + d  0;
which after some manipulations is
t(a~ux + b~uy + c~uz)  -(apx + bpy + cpz + d):
If P and ~u are given in homogeneous coordinates, this can be written as
t(H  ~u)  -(H P):
This is not really a legitimate geometric expression (since dot product should only be applied between vectors).
Actually the halfspace H should be thought of as a special geometric object, a sort of generalized normal vector.
(For example, when transformations are applied, normal vectors should be multiplied by the inverse transpose
matrix to maintain orthogonality.)
We consider three cases.

(H  ~u) > 0 : In this case we have the constraint
t 
-(H  P)
(H  ~u) :
Let t denote the right-hand side of this inequality. We trim the high-end of the intersection interval to
[t0; min(t1; t)].
(H  ~u) < 0 : In this case we have
t 
-(H  P)
(H  ~u) :
Let t denote the right-hand side of this inequality. In this case, we trim the low-end of the intersection
interval to [max(t0; t); t1].
(H  ~u) = 0 : In this case the ray is parallel to the plane. Either entirely above or below. We check the origin.
If (H  P)  0 then the origin lies in (or on the boundary of) the halfspace, and so we leave the current
interval unchanged. Otherwise, the origin lies outside the halfspace, and the intersection is empty. To
model this we can set t1 to any negative value, e.g., -1.
After we repeat this on each face of the polyhedron, we have the following possibilities:
Miss (t1 < t0) : In this case the ray does not intersect the polyhedron.
From inside (0 = t0  t1) : In this case, the origin is within the polyhedron. If t1 = 1, then the polyhedron
must be unbounded (e.g. like a cone) and there is no intersection. Otherwise, the first intersection point
is the point P + t1~u. In this case, if Hi is the halfspace that generated the intersection point, we use the
inward pointing normal normalize(-ai;-bi;-ci).
From outside (0 < t0  t1) : In this case, the origin is outside the polyhedron
