geometric details D = S 	B, i.e., the fine surface features
that have been removed, represent the high frequencies of S and are stored as detail information.
This allows reconstructing the original surface S by adding the geometric details back onto the
base surface: S = B  D. The special operators 	 and  are called the decomposition and
the reconstruction operator of the multiresolution framework, respectively. This multiresolution
surface representation is now enhanced by an editing operator, that is used to deform the smooth
base surface B into a modified version B0. Adding the geometric details onto the deformed base
surface then results in a multiresolution deformation S0 = B0  D.
Notice that in general more than one decomposition step is used to generate a hierarchy of
meshes S = S0, S1, . . . , Sk = B with decreasing geometric complexity. In this case the frequencies
that are lost from one level Si to the next smoother one Si+1 are stored as geometric details
Di+1 = Si 	Si+1, such that after deforming the base surface to B0, the modified original surface
can be reconstructed by S0 = B0Lk-1
i=0 Dk-i. Since the generalization to several hierarchy levels
is straightforward, we restrict our explanations to the simpler case of a two-band decomposition,
as shown in Fig. 11.7.
A complete multiresolution deformation framework has to provide the three basic operators
shown in Fig. 11.7: the decomposition operator (detail analysis), the editing operator (shape
deformation), and the reconstruction operator (detail synthesis). The decomposition is typically
performed by mesh smoothing or fairing (Chapter 7), and surface deformation has been discussed
in the previous sections. The missing component is a suitable representation for the geometric
detail D = S 	 B, which we describe in the following.
