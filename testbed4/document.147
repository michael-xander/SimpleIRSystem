Introduction
This chapter discusses some of the basic concepts behind computer graphics with particular
emphasis on how to get started with simple drawing in OpenGL. A major portion of the chapter
explains the simplest methods of drawing in OpenGL and various rendering modes. If this is
your first encounter with OpenGL, it is highly suggested that you look at the included sample
code and experiment with some of the OpenGL commands while reading this chapter.
The first topic considered is the different models for graphics displays. Of particular importance
for the topics covered later in the book is the idea that an arbitrary three-dimensional
geometrical shape can be approximated by a set of polygons – more specifically as a set of
triangles. Second, we discuss some of the basic methods for programming in OpenGL to display
simple two- and three-dimensional models made from points, lines, triangles, and other
polygons.We also describe how to set colors and polygonal orientations, how to enable hidden
surface removal, and how to make animation work with double buffering. The included sample
OpenGL code illustrates all these capabilities. Later chapters will discuss how to use transformations,
how to set the viewpoint, how to add lighting and shading, how to add textures, and
other topics.
I.1 Display Models
We start by describing three models for graphics display modes: (1) drawing points, (2) drawing
lines, and (3) drawing triangles and other polygonal patches. These three modes correspond
to different hardware architectures for graphics display. Drawing points corresponds roughly to
the model of a graphics image as a rectangular array of pixels. Drawing lines corresponds to
vector graphics displays. Drawing triangles and polygons corresponds to the methods used by
modern graphics display hardware for displaying three-dimensional images.
I.1.1 Rectangular Arrays of Pixels
The most common low-level model is to treat a graphics image as a rectangular array of pixels
in which, each pixel can be independently set to a different color and brightness. This is the
display model used for cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and televisions, for instance. If the pixels are
small enough, they cannot be seen individually by the human viewer, and the image, although
composed of points, can appear as a single smooth image. This technique is used in art aswell –
notably in mosaics and, even more so, in pointillism, where pictures are composed of small

or wireframe images of three-dimensional objects. The canonical example of vector graphics
systems are pen plotters; this includes the “turtle geometry” systems. Pen plotters have a
drawing pen that moves over a flat sheet of paper. The commands available include (a) pen
up, which lifts the pen up from the surface of the paper, (b) pen down, which lowers the point
of the pen onto the paper, and (c) move-to(x, y), which moves the pen in a straight line from
its current position to the point with coordinates x, y. When the pen is up, it moves without
drawing; when the pen is down, it draws as it moves (see Figure I.2). In addition, there may be
commands for switching to a different color pen as well as convenience commands to make it
easier to draw images.
Another example of vector graphics devices is vector graphics display terminals, which
traditionally are monochrome monitors that can draw arbitrary lines. On these vector graphics
display terminals, the screen is a large expanse of phosphor and does not have pixels. A
traditional oscilloscope is also an example of a vector graphics display device.
Vector graphics displays and pixel-based displays use very different representations of
images. In pixel-based systems, the screen image will be stored as a bitmap, namely, as a table
containing all the pixel colors. A vector graphics system, on the other hand, will store the
image as a list of commands – for instance as a list of pen up, pen down, and move commands.
Sucha list of commands is called a display list.
Nowadays, pixel-based graphics hardware is very prevalent, and thus even graphics systems
that are logically vector based are typically displayed on hardware that is pixel based.
The disadvantage is that pixel-based hardware cannot directly draw arbitrary lines and must
approximate lines with pixels. On the other hand, the advantage is that more sophisticated
figures, suchas filled regions, can be drawn.
Modern vector graphics systems incorporate more than just lines and include the ability to
draw curves, text, polygons, and other shapes such as circles and ellipses. These systems also
have the ability to fill in or shade a region with a color or a pattern. They generally are restricted
to drawing two-dimensional figures. Adobe’s PostScript language is a prominent example of a
modern vector graphics system.
I.1.3 Polygonal Modeling
One step up, in both abstraction and sophistication, is the polygonal model of graphics images. It
is very common for three-dimensional geometric shapes to be modeled first as a set of polygons
and then mapped to polygonal shapes on a two-dimensional display. The basic display hardware
is generally pixel based, but most computers now have special-purpose graphics hardware for
processing polygons or, at the very least, triangles. Graphics hardware for rendering triangles
