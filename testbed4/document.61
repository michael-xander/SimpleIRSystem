Together, our findings provide evidence for a substantial effect of
lighting on the perception of 3D shape in simple computer graphics
renditions. When smoothly curved objects are shaded with the
Phong model under a single point source, the perceived shape is
highly mutable depending on the lighting, and can differ considerably
from the intended shape. This has important implications for
the visualization of 3D data in industrial design, whenever precise
perception of 3D shape is required. Surprisingly, Phong illumination
is still probably the most commonly used shading model, both
for modelling in CAD software, and for design evaluation. Our results
may provide some insight into the problems experienced by
designers using digital models of their designs.
How might 3D shape visualization be improved? This is a topic of
active research. One obvious possibility would be to try to improve
the physical realism of the renderings, for example, by employing
global illumination rendering methods. Other authors [Ferwerda
et al. 2004] have shown that subjects are better at perceiving subtle
shape differences in car designs under global illumination than under
standard local shading models. Realistic illumination has other
benefits, for example, it is known to improve the perception of surface
reflectance [Fleming et al. 2004; te Pas and Pont 2005].
However, there are a number of caveats to this approach. The first
is that designers routinely require real-time rendering capabilities,
and global illumination is still not possible at useful framerates for
the mega-polygon models used in automobile design. The second
caveat is that there is evidence that the dependency of perceived
shape on the illumination conditions extends to real (as opposed
to CG) objects [Koenderink et al. 1996]. Indeed, whether illumination
is realistic or not, if the material has a substantial diffuse
component, the resulting pattern of isophotes (and consequently the
field of image orientations that could be measured by the front end
of the visual system) varies with the illumination.
