Occlusion tests using small, independent occluders,
such as geometry polygons or view-dependent planar
occluders, are inefficient because an object may be
partially hidden by two or more occluders and
therefore not discarded, but totally hidden by the joint
surface that the occluders may produce (Fig. 2). To
address this, fusion algorithms have been proposed
by many authors, as in [Sch00a] and [Kol00a]. These
methods try to combine the resulting frusta (in 3D
space) or produce aggregate footprints (in image
space) of the occluders in order to maximize the
culling effectiveness of closely packed but otherwise
unrelated occluders. Joining either the viewdependent
occluders or the resulting frusta or
projected polygons (image-space footprints) involves
expensive operations that have to be performed at
each frame. Furthermore, containment tests with nonconvex
(or multiple) frusta or non-convex polygons
that are generated from the joint projected occluders
are inherently more complex and time consuming
when compared to simple individual convex occluder
tests. Joining and visibility testing can be simplified
by generating approximate convex aggregations of
occluder clusters but in this case, an error is
introduced which may become intolerable, especially
when the viewer comes close to the occluders.
The method for occlusion culling presented here
relies on the use of convex solid occluder shapes in a
scene to block away geometry fragments (or
hierarchies of objects) from arbitrary view points. It
extends the work of Hudson et al [Hud97a] for
occlusion culling using shadow frusta to address the
inefficiency of partial visibility discussed above,
while avoiding the expensive joining calculations.
Shadow frustum culling uses – usually convex -
planar occluder polygons, which can be part of the
visible scene geometry or dummy (proxy) occluders,
in order to create semi-infinite conical frusta with
edges emanating from the viewpoint and passing
through the polygon’s vertices (Fig. 1). A geometrical
entity, which can be anything from a simple polygon
to a scene-graph hierarchy of complex objects, is
blocked if its bounding volume is completely
contained within the frustum. In the case of a
hierarchy of objects, if it cannot be safely discarded
as a whole due to partial containment into the shadow
frustum, the tree is traversed in search of a potentially
fully hidden sub-tree. Hudson et. al. [Hud97a]
proposed a dynamic occluder selection mechanism
which maintains a small list of most efficient
occluders for each frame, selected among the full set
of planar occluders using proximity, alignment and
area coverage criteria. More about this selection
