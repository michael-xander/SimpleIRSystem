A procedure has been developed to improve
polygonal surface mesh quality while maintaining the
essential characteristics of the discrete surface. The surface
characteristics are preserved by repositioning mesh
vertices so that they remain on the original discrete
surface. The repositioning is performed in a series of
triangular-facet-based local parametric spaces. The
movement of the mesh vertices is driven by a nonlinear
numerical optimization process. Two optimization approaches
are described, one which improves the quality
of elements as much as possible and the other which
improves element quality but also keeps the new mesh as
close as possible to the original mesh.

1 Introduction
This paper describes a procedure to improve the quality
of polygonal surface meshes by node repositioning while
preserving the essential characteristics of the discrete
surface and keeping the mesh close to the original configuration.
The need for improvement of such meshes
arises primarily in finite volume simulations where they
form interior and exterior boundaries of general polyhedral
meshes.
While previous research has focused on improving
the quality of triangular and quadrilateral meshes [1–7],
little attention has been paid to the improvement of
polygonal meshes. Most of this work is devoted to
smoothing (denoising) of a discrete surface represented
