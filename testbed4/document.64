Phong shading is one of the best known, and at the same time simplest techniques to arrive at
realistic images when rendering 3D geometric models. However, despite (or maybe due to) its
success and its widespread use, some aspects remain to be clarified with respect to its validity
and robustness. This might be caused by the fact that the Phong method is based on geometric
arguments, illumination models, and clever heuristics. In this article we address some of the
fundamentals that underlie Phong shading, such as the computation of vertex normals for
nonmanifold models and the adequacy of linear interpolation and we apply a new interpolation
technique to achieve an efficient and qualitatively improved result.

1. INTRODUCTION
Computer graphics, when viewed as a technical discipline, is relatively
young. Compared with mathematics or physics, for example, not much
tradition has emerged as yet as to the directions in which specialized
research will develop. An ongoing stream of new ideas and methods of a
wide variety are being generated by workers in the field, whereas the
eventual fruitfulness of these ideas and methods may only show up later.
Only a few of the results that have emerged so far may be classified as
paradigms, in that they are sufficiently mature and well established to

continue as a template for further development. Among these established
methods are concepts such as the Z-buffer algorithm, the use of parametric
surfaces, ray-tracing, and Phong shading.
Identifying a paradigm in retrospect is not too hard; however, describing
it at a sufficient level of abstraction in order to catch its crucial concept
often requires some insight. This may help us to understand the cause for
the success of that paradigm, and it helps in exploring new applications,
alternatives, or ramifications.
For instance, the concept of Phong shading [Phong 1975] is introduced
(e.g., in Foley et al. [1990], p. 738) as mostly an extension of Gouraud
shading [Gouraud 1971] where one of the flaws of the latter is corrected, in
that highlights in the interiors of polygons can be reproduced. So at the
lowest level of abstraction, Phong shading could be seen as a method for the
synthesis of highlights. However true, this formulation would do no justice
to the creative process that gave rise to Phong shading as it is currently
used in most rendering systems. First of all, the notion “Phong shading”
refers to both an illumination model and an interpolation scheme for
normal vectors. The illumination model relates the illumination in a point
P to the local normal vector nP in that point, and the interpolation scheme
defines nP in terms of the normal vectors in the vertices of the polygon to
which P belongs. The observations, essential for devising Phong shading,
are:
(1) the visual appearance of an object is not only determined by its
geometrical shape but also by the distribution of reflected light;
(2) the amount of light that is reflected from a surface segment depends
chiefly on the local surface normal;
(3) A C0 (continuous) normal vector field matches with a C1 (differentiable)
surface geometry;
(4) piecewise linear interpolation is a simple way to achieve a C0 vector
field; and
(5) decoupling the orientation of the surface normals and the true shape of
the underlying geometrical model may cause a simple polyhedral model
to produce a visual appearance of a smoothly curved object, which
otherwise could only be achieved with a much denser polygonal mesh.
Summarizing (1) to (5) yields an even more abstract formulation of the
quintessence of Phong shading: normal vectors can be used to enhance the
visual appearance of geometrical objects. Notice that in the latter formulation,
we have abstracted away from some ingredients of the more commonly
used meaning of Phong shading. The following points concern this abstraction.
(1) The notion of visual appearance does not necessarily refer to highlights
only, but may include other aspects of illumination;
(2) apart from linearly interpolating normal vectors, there might be other
means for achieving the light reflection distribution of a (piecewise) C1
surface geometry;

underlying surface geometry in order to enhance
