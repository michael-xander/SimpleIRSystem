If there is one surrounding polygon of course use the color of the polygon to render that particular area of interest mind you not the entire polygon must be rendered only that rectangular area of interest which could be the entire image or a part of the image under consideration to paint you must paint with that particular polygonal color if that polygon is surrounding the entire area of interest. Now these are the cases which we have seen in this slide earlier if there is only one. 
Now the case comes when there is more than one polygon. When there is more than one polygon that is the case which we have to consider. Of course in that in those cases do not consider any disjoint polygons and still if there are more than one that is two or more polygons within the rectangular area of interest and various relationships exist of course again only surrounding contained and intersection relationships are to be considered disjoint case or not consider keep in mind. 
Now you have more than one polygon. Under that you have a special case where there is one surrounding polygon in front which if you can find out by the help of the z coordinate intersection test with respect to these four vertices of the rectangular parallelepiped viewport parallel to z axis if you visualize rectangular cube parallelepiped and you are viewing through a viewport and you are visualizing that there are so many polygons inside and there is one in front of you. The closest to you is obscuring all other polygons then you should use that particular polygon to paint that rectangular area of interest. Otherwise see if none of these cases happens that means you are not having a single polygon case number one, you are having multiple polygons and out of this you are not able to find out one surrounding polygon which is in front of you. So if none of these cases happen what you do you split the rectangular area of interest into four parts that is what you do and keep on sub dividing. This is why it is called a divide and conquer strategy working in the image space and you keep on sub dividing starting from the root node. 
Remember the quad tree representation which we talked about for an image take, the entire image split into four parts four quadrants if necessary, you did this in the Bresenham’s line algorithm case, ellipse and circle as well and we talked about a quad tree representation and an extension of that was Octrees in the case of solid modeling in 3D. So I repeat again, quad tree representation four parts each of those sub images or four quadrants could be again sub divided if necessary you keep on doing that till you may reach in a certain case if you keep on sub dividing into the maximum resolution the maximum height of the level of the depth of the tree which you get is just one pixel resolution. 
You might reach one pixel resolution at the maximum level of the tree that if you keep on splitting and splitting and so on you may reach one pixel where you cannot sub divide 
any further. And that case of course what you have do is you have to render that pixel with what polygon is in front of you corresponding to the particular pixel. That is what we were discussing and pick up a few case studies as examples of area sub division method. 
Couple of examples as we did for other cases also, here we pick up a few more case studies. Let us look at this simple example. Stage one to be analyzed where within the entire image there are two polygons but in this case there are two triangles. So if you have passed those entire four tests first of all there is no single polygon within the area of interest. 
What is the area of interest A Y here? The entire image, the entire image is your area of interest and you find that there are more than one polygon and there is no single surrounding polygon. there is no single surrounding polygon which is in front of you so there is no other option but split this area of interest in this case it is the starting image which is split into four equal parts or four quadrants. So do that and let us see what happens. 
When you split this is what results in. Of course you split and do some processing and that is the result which you get if you split this entire image into four parts. Let us say we have four quadrants northeast northwest southwest southeast we will take this is quadrant number one two three and four that is four children of a root node, the entire tree which is split into four parts four children is what you have and those are the quadrants one two three and four. So quadrants one two three and four, four parts you can see here and you start analyzing them one by one. 
Let us start with quadrant number two. It is a very simple case of an intersecting case intersecting contained the same. What you do when you find an intersecting polygon a single one? You paint with the background color which is in this case white as I have chosen here but it could be black does not matter and the rest of the part of that quadrant you paint with that intersecting overlapping polygon. This concept holds good for quadrant two three and four. All the three quadrants will have a case of intersecting polygon and a single one and we know what do in all of these cases which is the same case you first paint with the background color and then paint with the polygon which is overlapping with that particular AOI or area of interest. 
We are talking about quadrants two three and four and not quadrant one. The quadrant one will be here so two three and four is what you are looking and for all these two three and four quadradents you have an intersecting case and that is what you have done. So the quadradents two three and four had been processed. 
Quadrant number one is a special case what happens in quadradent one? If you carefully watch it contains two polygons again. Like the original case of two polygons and there is no surrounding polygon in front so quadrant number one is the only quadrant out of these four after the first split. After the first split you got four quadrants and the three out of those four was an intersecting case intersecting
