In computer graphics, we work with sets of geometric objects, such as lines, polygons,
and polyhedra. Such objects exist in a three-dimensional world and have properties
that can be described using concepts such as length and angles. As we discovered
working in two dimensions, we can define most geometric objects using a limited set
of simple entities. These basic geometric objects and the relationships among them
can be described using three fundamental types: scalars, points, and vectors.
Although we will consider each type from a geometric perspective, each of these
types also can be defined formally, as in Appendix B, as obeying a set of axioms.
Although ultimately we will use the geometric instantiation of each type, we want to
take great care in distinguishing between the abstract definition of each entity and any
particular example, or implementation, of it. By taking care here, we can avoid many
subtle pitfalls later. Although we will work in three-dimensional spaces, virtually all
our results will hold in n-dimensional spaces.
3.1.1 Geometric Objects
Our fundamental geometric object is a point. In a three-dimensional geometric system,
a point is a location in space. The only property that a point possesses is that
point’s location; a mathematical point has neither a size nor a shape.
Points are useful in specifying geometric objects but are not sufficient by themselves.
We need real numbers to specify quantities such as the distance between two
points. Real numbers—and complex numbers, which we will use occasionally—are
examples of scalars. Scalars are objects that obey a set of rules that are abstractions
of the operations of ordinary arithmetic. Thus, addition and multiplication are defined
and obey the usual rules such as commutivity and associativity. Every scalar has
multiplicative and additive inverses, which implicitly define subtraction and division.
We need one additional type—the vector—to allow us to work with directions.1
Physicists and mathematicians use the termvector for any quantity with direction and
magnitude. Physical quantities, such as velocity and force, are vectors. A vector does
not, however, have a fixed location in space.
In computer graphics, we often connect points with directed line segments, as
shown in Figure 3.1. A directed line segment has both magnitude—its length—
and direction—its orientation—and thus is a vector. Because vectors have no fixed
position, the directed line segments shown in Figure 3.2 are identical because they
have the same direction and magnitude. We will often use the terms vector and
directed line segment synonymously.
Vectors can have their lengths altered by real numbers. Thus, in Figure 3.3(a),
line segment A has the same direction as line segment B, but B has twice the length
1. The types such as vec3 used by GLSL and that we have used in our classes are not geometric types
but rather storage types. Hence, we can use a vec3 to store information about a point, a vector, or a
color. Unfortunately, the choice of names by GLSL can cause some confusion.

that A has, so we can write B = 2A. We can also combine directed line segments by
the head-to-tail rule, as shown in Figure 3.3(b). Here, we connect the head of vector
A to the tail of vector C to form a new vector D, whose magnitude and direction are
determined by the line segment from the tail of A to the head of C. We call this new
vector, D, the sum of A and C and write D = A + C. Because vectors have no fixed
positions, we can move any two vectors as necessary to form their sum graphically.
Note that we have described two fundamental operations: the addition of two vectors
and the multiplication of a vector by a scalar.
If we consider two directed line segments, A and E, as shown in Figure 3.4, with
the same length but opposite directions, their sum as defined by the head-to-tail
addition has no length. This sum forms a special vector called the zero vector, which
we denote 0, that has a magnitude of zero. Because it has no length, the orientation of
this vector is undefined. We say that E is the inverse of A and we can write E =-A.
Using inverses of vectors, scalar-vector expressions such as A + 2B - 3C make sense.
Although we can multiply a vector by a scalar to change its length, there are no
obvious sensible operations between two points that produce another point. Nor are
there operations between a point and a scalar that produce a point. There is, however,
an operation between points and directed line segments (vectors), as illustrated in
Figure 3.5. We can use a directed line segment to move from one point to another.
We call this operation point-vector addition, and it produces a new point. We write
this operation as P = Q + v.We can see that the vector v displaces the point Q to the
new location P.
Looking at things slightly differently, any two points define a directed line segment
or vector from one point to the second. We call this operation point-point
subtraction, and we can write it as v = P - Q. Because vectors can be multiplied
by scalars, some expressions involving scalars, vectors, and points make sense, such
as P + 3v, or 2P - Q + 3v (because it can be written as P + (P - Q) + 3v, a sumof
a point and a vector), whereas others, such as P + 3Q - v, do not.
3.1.2 Coordinate-Free Geometry
Points exist in space regardless of any reference or coordinate system. Thus, we do not
need a coordinate system to specify a point or a vector. This fact may seem counter

to your experiences, but it is crucial to understanding geometry and how to build
graphics systems. Consider the two-dimensional example shown in Figure 3.6. Here
we see a coordinate system defined by two axes, an origin, and a simple geometric
object, a square. We can refer to the point at the lower-left corner of the square as
having coordinates (1, 1) and note that the sides of the square are orthogonal to each
other and that the point at (3, 1) is 2 units from the point at (1, 1). Now suppose
that we remove the axes as shown in Figure 3.7. We can no longer specify where the
points are. But those locations were relative to an arbitrary location of the origin
and the orientation of the axes. What is more important is that the fundamental
geometric relationships are preserved. The square is still a square, orthogonal lines
are still orthogonal, and distances between points remain the same.
Of course, we may find it inconvenient, at best, to refer to a specific point as “that
point over there” or “the blue point to the right of the red one.” Coordinate systems
and frames (see Section 3.3) solve this reference problem, but for now we want to see
just how far we can get following a coordinate-free approach that does not require an
arbitrary reference system.
3.1.3 The Mathematical View: Vector and Affine Spaces
If we view scalars, points, and vectors as members of mathematical sets, then we
can look at a variety of abstract spaces for representing and manipulating these
sets of objects. Mathematicians have explored a variety of such spaces for applied
problems, ranging from the solution of differential equations to the approximation
of mathematical functions. The formal definitions of the spaces of interest to us—
vector spaces, affine spaces, and Euclidean spaces—are given in Appendix B. We are
concerned with only those examples in which the elements are geometric types.
We start with a set of scalars, any pair of which can be combined to formanother
scalar through two operations, called addition and multiplication. If these operations
obey the closure, associativity, commutivity, and inverse properties described in Appendix
B, the elements form a scalar field. Familiar examples of scalars include the
real numbers, complex numbers, and rational functions.
Perhaps the most important mathematical space is the (linear) vector space. A
vector space contains two distinct types of entities: vectors and scalars. In addition
to the rules for combining scalars, within a vector space, we can combine scalars and
vectors to form new vectors through scalar–vector multiplication and vectors with
vectors through vector–vector addition. Examples of mathematical vector spaces
include n-tuples of real numbers and the geometric operations on our directed line
segments.
In a linear vector space, we do not necessarily have a way of measuring a scalar
quantity. A Euclidean space is an extension of a vector space that adds a measure of
size or distance and allows us to define such things as the length of a line segment.
An affine space is an extension of the vector space that includes an additional
type of object: the point. Although there are no operations between two points or
between a point and a scalar that yield points, there is an operation of vector–point
addition that produces a new point. Alternately, we can say there is an operation
3.1 Scalars, Points, and Vectors 119
called point–point subtraction that produces a vector from two points. Examples of
affine spaces include the geometric operations on points and directed line segments
that we introduced in Section 3.1.1.
In these abstract spaces, objects can be defined independently of any particular
representation; they are simply members of various sets. One of the major vectorspace
concepts is that of representing a vector in terms of one or more sets of basis
vectors. Representation (Section 3.3) provides the tie between abstract objects and
their implementation. Conversion between representations leads us to geometric
transformations.
3.1.4 The Computer Science View
Although the mathematician may prefer to think of scalars, points, and vectors as
members of sets that can be combined according to certain axioms, the computer
scientist prefers to see them as abstract data types (ADTs). An ADT is a set of operations
on data; the operations are defined independently of how the data are represented
internally or of how the operations are implemented. The notion of data
abstraction is fundamental to modern computer science. For example, the operation
of adding an element to a list or of multiplying two polynomials can be defined independently
of how the list is stored or of how real numbers are represented on a
particular computer. People familiar with this concept should have no trouble distinguishing
between objects (and operations on objects) and objects’ representations
(or implementations) in a particular system. Froma computational point of view, we
should be able to declare geometric objects through code such as
regardless of the internal representation or implementation of the objects on a particular
system. In object-oriented languages, such as C++, we can use language features,
such as classes and overloading of operators, so we can write lines of code, such as
q = p+a*v;
using our geometric data types. Of course, first we must define functions that perform
the necessary operations; so that we can write them, we must look at the mathematical
functions that we wish to implement. First, we will define our objects. Then
we will look to certain abstract mathematical spaces to help us with the operations
among them.
