Introduction to Digital Image Processing (SC874)
Course Level: Intermediate
Instructor: K.S. Thyagarajan, Consultant (United States)
Course Details
This course deals with the theory of digital image processing. The focus of this short course is to introduce the audience to basics of digital image processing and to motivate them to learn the subject in depth and apply the concepts in their projects. The attendees learn basic techniques involved in improving a picture quality as in image sharpening or contrast enhancement. Image transforms deal with the representation of an image in orthogonal basis images. They are useful in image compression, classification and understanding. This course has been taught several times at senior undergraduate level by the author at San Diego State University and other institutions. However, due to the limited duration of this short course, the contents are dealt with less mathematical rigor.

Learning Outcomes
This course will enable you to:

convert color images from one coordinate system to another
exploit human visual perception to enhance images
enhance poor contrast images
apply 2D DCT and wavelet transform to images and analyze the coefficients
apply spatial and frequency-domain filtering to images
Intended Audience
This course is suitable to engineers, scientists, and managers in the fields of EE, communications, entertainment and digital arts. Attendees will also benefit from the related course SC875, Introduction to Image and Video Compression.
