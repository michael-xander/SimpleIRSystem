The means to produce real-time 3D graphical applications have improved over the
last few years tremendously. Hardware is becoming more and more powerful as new
processors, chipsets and memories are introduced. But the needs and expectations of
the users have grown even more rapidly. Scenes must be modeled with fine detail,
which leads to large models with many polygons. Users often want interaction with
the model. And all this has to be rendered at speeds that enable real-time animation -
which means at least 10 frames per second.
The hardware improvements alone do not suffice. The size of the models that meet
the requirements grow more rapidly than the size of the models that can be rendered.
The solution to this situation is output sensitivity. Output sensitivity means that the runtime
depends on the size of the output, not on the size of the input. Put it another way,
an algorithm is output sensitive if it has a runtime per frame that is ??
	
, where
 is number of visible primitives, 	 is total number of all primitives and 

is the overhead imposed by the model. (Sudarsky & Gotsman, 1996)
This can be achieved several ways. One technique is level-of-detail control, which
means that objects that are farther away are rendered with less detail. Another technique
is to render nothing that is not visible to the viewer. The process of leaving
out the non-visible parts from the model is called visibility culling. Visibility culling
actually contains three different mechanisms: back-face culling, view-frustrum culling
and occlusion culling. Back-face culling means leaving out the back-faces of the polygons,
view-frustrum culling means ignoring all objects that are not contained in the
view frustrum. Occlusion culling means leaving out all the polygons that are occluded
1
by other polygons. An object is occluded by another object if it is totally hidden behind
it. Thus the occluder conceals the occluded object. Usually occlusion culling
techniques include view-frustrum culling as a part of the algorithm. Occlusion culling
is especially important in dense models, like cities or buildings, where a large portion
of the objects are occluded.
This paper concentrates on dynamic occlusion culling algorithms. Word dynamic
has unfortunately many meanings. Sometimes dynamic means that the culling computation
is done on-the-fly, depending on the viewpoint, and the result is a real-time
animated model in which the user can walk or fly around freely. But often dynamic
means that the objects in the model are not static but can move just like the camera
moves. This paper discusses both cases.
Chapter 2 discusses different algorithms that are based on hierarchical representations
of the model. In chapter 3, one tries to adopt two of these techniques to handle
models with moving objects. Chapter 4 introduces different approaches to handle the
moving objects. In chapter 5, conclusions are drawn based upon the contents of the
previous chapters.
2 HIERARCHICAL REAL-TIME ALGORITHMS
For algorithms to be output sensitive, they cannot iterate through all objects and decide
the ones that are visible. Instead, they must reject large portions of the object-space
with one query, if these large portions are hidden. This usually requires the use of
some hierarchical data structures.
The algorithms in this section do the visibility culling on-the-fly, enabling (at least
almost) real-time rendering of models. They all use some kind of hierarchical data
structure that divides the object-space into regions. This means that the model must
be preprocessed to obtain this hierarchical representation. If an object in the model
moved, the whole structure should be preprocessed again. Since the preprocessing is
very time-consuming, these algorithms cannot be used in models where objects are
moving.
The algorithms presented are Hierarchical Z-buffer (Greene et al. , 1993), BSP
tree projection algorithm (Naylor, 1992) and cPLP (Klosowski & Silva, 2001). Other
similar algorithms use for example hierarchical occlusion maps (Zhang et al. , 1997)
and kD-trees (Coorg & Teller, 1997).
2.1 Hierarchical Z-buffer
Hierarchical Z-buffer algorithm (HZB), first introduced in (Greene et al. , 1993), is
an improvement of traditional Z-buffer algorithm. It exploits two hierarchical data
structures: an octree in object-space and a Z-pyramid in image-space (see figure 1).
The octree contains the whole model inside a cube. The cube is then divided into
eight subcubes (see figure 1), which are then divided again. Each primitive in the
model is associated with the smallest possible enclosing cube. When the construction
is ready, each octree cube knows its direct children and the polygons associated to it.
This construction of the model into an octree is done at a preprocessing stage.
