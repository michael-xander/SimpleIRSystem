Lecture 6: Geometry and Geometric Programming
Reading: Appendix A in Hearn and Baker.
Geometric Programming: We are going to leave our discussion of OpenGL for a while, and discuss some of the basic elements of geometry, which will be needed for the rest of the course. There are many areas of computer science that involve computation with geometric entities. This includes not only computer graphics, but also areas like computer-aided design, robotics, computer vision, and geographic information systems. In this and the next few lectures we will consider how this can be done, and how to do this in a reasonably clean and painless way.
Computer graphics deals largely with the geometry of lines and linear objects in 3-space, because light travels in straight lines. For example, here are some typical geometric problems that arise in designing programs for computer graphics.
Geometric Intersections: Given a cube and a ray, does the ray strike the cube? If so which face? If the ray is re?ected off of the face, what is the direction of the re?ection ray? Orientation: Three noncollinear points in 3-space de?ne a unique plane. Given a fourth point q, is it above, below, or on this plane?
Transformation: Given unit cube, what are the coordinates of its vertices after rotating it 30 degrees about the vector (1,2,1).
Change of coordinates: A cube is represented relative to some standard coordinate system. What are its coordinates relative to a different coordinate system (say, one centered at the camera's location)?
Such basic geometric problems are fundamental to computer graphics, and over the next few lectures, our goal will be to present the tools needed to answer these sorts of questions. (By the way, a good source of information on how to solve these problems is the series of books entitled "Graphics Gems". Each book is a collection of many simple graphics problems and provides algorithms for solving them.)

Coordinate-free programming: If you look at almost any text on computer graphics (ours included) you will ?nd that the section on geometric computing begins by introducing coordinates, then vectors, then matrices. Then what follows are many long formulas involving many 4×4 matrices. These formulas are handy, because (along with some procedures for matrix multiplication) we can solve many problems in computer graphics. Unfortunately, from the perspective of software design they are a nightmare, because the intention of the programmer has been lost in all the "matrix crunching." The product of a matrix and a vector can have many meanings. It may represent a change of coordinate systems, it may represent a transformation of space, and it may represent a perspective projection.
We will attempt to develop a clean, systematic way of thinking about geometric computations. This method is called coordinate-free programming (so named by Tony DeRose, its developer). Rather than reducing all computations to vector-matrix products, we will express geometric computations in the form of high-level geometric operations. These in turn will be implemented using low-level matrix computations, but if you use a good object-oriented programming language (such as C++ or Java) these details are hidden. Henceforth, when the urge to write down an expression involving point coordinates comes to you, ask yourself whether it is possible to describe this operation in a high-level coordinate-free form.
Ideally, this should be the job of a good graphics API. Indeed, OpenGL does provide the some support for geometric operations. For example, it provides procedures for performing basic af?ne transformations. Unfortunately, a user of OpenGL is still very aware of underlying presence of vectors and matrices in programming. A really well designed API would allow us to conceptualize geometry on a higher level.
Geometries: Before beginning we should discuss a little history. Geometry is one of the oldest (if not the oldest) branches of mathematics. Its origins were in land surveying (and hence its name: geo=earth, and metria=measure). Surveying became an important problem as the advent of agriculture required some way of de?ning the boundaries between one family's plot and anothers.
Ancient civilizations (the Egyptians, for example) must have possessed a fairly sophisticated understanding of geometry in order to build complex structures like the pyramids. However, it was not until much later in the time of Euclid in Greece in the 3rd century BC, that the mathematical ?eld of geometry was ?rst axiomatized and made formal. Euclid worked without the use of a coordinate system. It was much later in the 17th century when cartesian coordinates were developed (by Descartes), which allowed geometric concepts to be expressed arithmetically.
In the late 19th century a revolutionary shift occurred in people's view of geometry (and mathematics in general). Up to this time, no one questioned that there is but one geometry, namely the Euclidean geometry. Mathematicians like Lobachevski and Gauss, suggested that there may be other geometric systems which are just as consistent and valid as Euclidean geometry, but in which different axioms apply. These are called noneuclidean geometries, and they played an important role in Einstein's theory of relativity.
We will discuss three basic geometric systems: af?ne geometry, Euclidean geometry, and projective geometry. Af?ne geometry is the most basic of these. Euclidean geometry builds on af?ne geometry by adding the concepts of angles and distances. Projective geometry is more complex still, but it will be needed in performing perspective projections.
Af?ne Geometry: The basic elements of af?ne geometry are scalars (which we can just think of as being real numbers), points and free vectors (or simply vectors). Points are used to specify position. Free vectors are used to specify direction and magnitude, but have no ?xed position. The term "free" means that vectors do not necessarily emanate from some position (like the origin), but ?oat freely about in space. There is a special vector called the zero vector, ~ 0, that has no magnitude, such that ~ v +~0=~0+~ v=~ v. Note in particular that we did not de?ne a zero point or "origin" for af?ne space. (Although we will eventually have to break down and de?ne something like this in order, simply to be able to de?ne coordinates for our points.)
You might ask, why make a distinction between points and vectors? Both can be represented in the same way as a list of coordinates. The reason is to avoid hiding the intention of the programmer. For example, it makes perfect sense to multiply a vector and a scalar (we stretch the vector by this amount). It is not so clear that it

makes sense to multiply a point by a scalar. By keeping these concepts separate, we make it possible to check the validity of geometric operations.
We will use the following notational conventions. Points will be denotes with upper-case Roman letters (e.g., P, Q, and R), vectors will be denoted with lower-case Roman letters (e.g., u, v, and w) and often to emphasize this we will add an arrow (e.g., ~ u, ~ v, ~ w), and scalars will be represented as lower case Greek letters (e.g., a, ß, ?). In our programs scalars will be translated to Roman (e.g., a, b, c).
The table below lists the valid combinations of these entities. The formal de?nitions are pretty much what you would expect. Vector operations are applied in the same way that you learned in linear algebra. For example, vectors are added in the usual "tail-to-head" manner. The difference P -Q of two points results in a free vector directed from Q to P. Point-vector addition R+~ v is de?ned to be the translation of R by displacement ~ v. Note that some operations (e.g. scalar-point multiplication, and addition of points) are explicitly not de?ned.
