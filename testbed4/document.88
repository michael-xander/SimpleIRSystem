Lines
There are a number of ways to draw lines. Generally, they all boil down to the same basic ideas, and have roughly comparable speeds. The algorithm presented here is the one I felt had the best mixture of simplicity, efficiency and small size. It has the disadvantage of being less exact than some other algorithms for lines of rational slopes. We will first start with special cases, then move to more general cases.
The simplest lines to draw are the horizontal and vertical ones. As can be imagined easily by the reader from the last section, we start with the topmost or leftmost pixel, draw it, then either add 1 or <width> to memory location and draw the next pixel. And so on, for the length of the line.
The next step up is an angled line. If the line is not vertical nor horizontal, then it can be expressed as y=mx+b or x=ny+c, with n=1/m and c=-b/m, whichever is preferred. The representation one has to use is whichever of the two has the smallest m or n. This is to ensure that there are no large gaps between the pixels of a line. Afterwards, we initialize (x0,y0) to be one endpoint of the line. If we chose y=mx+b, we should be using the leftmost endpoint for (x0,y0). We draw (x0,y0), then increment x, and add m to y. Then we draw the new point. The extension to the x=ny+c form is left to the reader.
Notice that the previous paragraph is simply an application of forward differencing studied previously. The witty reader will easily imagine the extension of this to higher degree polynomials. It is also possible to extend incremental algorithms to circles and ellipses, amongst others, but we will not go into this.
In some applications, such as polygon drawing, one of either y=mx+b or x=ny+c will be preferred even if the slope is greater than 1.

Note that the topic of line drawing can be extended much more than this. Antialiased lines, line width and patterns, endpoint shape are all topics that we will not cover.
This algorithm has the nice property of being a special case of forward differencing. It's also fast and has no comparisons in the so-called inner loop. (Comparisons have a tendency to flush prefetch queues in CPU's, which results in relatively long delays in the inner loop).
However it has the disadvantage of accumulating roundoff error at each new pixel. This should not be a problem in general, but when utmost precision is needed, an alternate algorithm which does not accumulate error might be considered.
The algorithm works without any error accumulation (the only error is the roundoff to the nearest pixel). The idea is as follows. We first observe that the slope m is a rational of the form a/b. Let's assume m is positive and less than 1. We can make a special case for each of the 8 octants such that this is true.
Next, let's assume y0 is of the form N+c/b, where c is some integer between 0 and b. Then, when adding the slope to the current y, we get N+(c+a)/b. However, now we need to check whether c+a is more than b. If it is, then we rewrite as: N+(c+a)/b=N+(c+a-b+b)/b=N+1+(c+a-b)/b. This means that whenever c+a is more than b, we subtract b from it and add 1 to N. The pixel coordinate in y that we actually draw is N. (This implies that we're truncating y. If we want to round off rather, we can add 0.5 to the original y0, which will have the net effect of rounding to the closest integer. The denominator can be doubled to avoid roundoff in the .5). Pseudocode for this follows (integer endpoints are assumed, this can be generalized to rational endpoints of course).
Let (x0,y0) and (x1,y1) be the endpoints of the line segment, such that (x1,y1) is in the first octant relative to (x0,y0). Let a=2*(y1-y0) Let b=2*(x1-x0) Let N=y0 Let c=(x1-x0)
for x varying from x0 to x1 by steps of one, do putpixel(x,N) add a to c if c>=b then subtract b from c add 1 to N end if end for
Polygon drawing
71
Let us first define a few terms, in an intuitive and geometric fashion. A polygon is, as can be seen above, a 2d object with area, delimited by edges. The edges are line segments, and there is a finite number of edges.
Polygons that do not self-intersect can be said to be either convex or concave. The polygon above is self-intersecting. A convex polygon is one for which the inside angle at any vertex is less than or equal to 180 degrees. All other polygons are said to be concave. Sometimes, it is said that a particular vertex is concave, which is not entirely correct, but rather means that the inside angle at that vertex is more than 180 degrees.
What interests us most is filled primitive. It is relatively easy to draw a wire frame polygon using only line drawing routines described previously (hidden line removal then becomes a problem).
The star-shaped polygon shown above is very interesting to us because it exhibits the more interesting properties we want our polygons to have. The grayed areas are considered to be inside the polygon, where the white areas are outside the polygon. This means that the inner pentagon is considered to be outside. The rule for determining whether a point lies inside or outside the polygon is as follows.
To determine if a point lies in or out of a polygon, draw a line from that point to infinity (any direction, far far away). Now find the number of times that line intersects the polygon edges. If it is odd, the point is in, if it is even, the point is out. This is called the even-odd rule by the industry. It is recommended that you try this with the star above and note that it works no matter what point you pick and no matter what direction you draw the line in.
The basic idea of the line polygon drawing algorithm is as follows. For each scanline (horizontal line on the screen), find the points of intersection with the edges of the polygon, labeling them 1 through n for n intersections (it is of note that n will always be even except in degenerate cases). Then, draw a horizontal line segment between intersections 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, ..., n-1 and n. Do this for all scanlines and you are done.
Probably, you might want to restrict yourself to scanlines that are actually spanned by the polygon. Also, there are a few things to note.
If the polygon is convex, there will always be only one span per scanline. That is generally not true for concave polygons (though it can accidentally happen).
72
Here is pseudocode for a polygon filling algorithm.
Let an edge be denoted (x0,y0)-(x1,y1), where y0=y1. Edges also have a "current x" value, denoted cx. Initialize cx to x0. One should also compute the slope of all edges, denoted s, which is (x1-x0)/(y1-y0) (we are using the x=ny+c representation). Let IET be the inactive edge table, initially containing all edges Let AET be the active edge table, initially empty
Sort the IET's edges by increasing values of y0 Let the initial scanline number be the y0 of the first edge in the IET
Repeat While scanline=y0 of the topmost edge in the IET Move topmost edge from IET to AET End while
(*) Sort AET in increasing values of cx
For every edge in the AET If edge's y1=scanline, then remove edge from AET Else add the slope "s" to "cx". End for
For each pair of edge in the AET Draw a horizontal segment on current scanline between column "cx0" and "cx1", where "cx0" is the "cx" value for the first edge in the pair and "cx1" is the "cx" value for the second edge in the pair End for Until the AET is empty
It is of note that the line marked by (*) can be optimized out. If the polygon is not self-intersecting, we just need to make sure the AET is properly sorted when we insert a new edge into it.
It should be noted that edges that are parallel to the scanline should not be put in the IET. You might also need to clip the polygon to the viewport, which can be added to the polygon blitting code.

Visible surface determination
Introduction
One of the problems we have yet to address, when several objects project to the same area on screen, how do you decide which gets displayed. Intuitively, the closest object should be the one to be displayed. Unfortunately, this definition is very hard to handle. We will usually say that the object to be displayed will be the one with the smallest z value in eye space, which is a bit easier to work with. A corollary of this is that objects with the largest 1/z value get displayed, this latter observation has applications which will be explained later.
Visible surface determination can be done in a number of ways, each has its advantages, disadvantages and applications. Hidden line removal is used when wire frames are generated. This might be useful for a vector display, but will not be covered in here. When dealing with filled primitives, there are several classes of visible surface determination. There is also the question of object precision, device precision, and more, these topics will not be discussed here.
Perhaps the most intuitive visible surface determination algorithm is the so-called "painter's algorithm", which works the same way a painter does. Namely, it draws objects that are further away first, then draws objects that are closer. The advantage of this is it's simple. The disadvantages are that it writes several times to some areas of the display device, and also that some objects cannot be ordered correctly.
The painter's algorithm can be generalized into the depth-sorting algorithm, which sort the primitives from back to front and then draw. The depth sorting algorithm also resolves cases that painter's algorithm does not.
Another algorithm is space partitioning trees such as BSP (binary space partitions) trees. The advantage of this algorithm is to generate a correct ordering of the primitives quickly and correctly no matter where the viewer is. The disadvantage is that it is hard to add any polygons to a scene thus rendered, or to deform it in a nonlinear way. Approximations can be made.
74
Yet another way of doing visible surface determination is the class of algorithms generally referred to as "scan-line algorithms". These algorithms, though somewhat slower than depth sorting, have the advantage of drawing to each and every pixel of the display device once and only once. Thus there is no need to clear the display in the first place, and pixels are not written to needlessly. Incidentally, this algorithm is very useful for display devices where it is impossible or difficult to erase or rewrite to pixels, such as printers. The disadvantages are that it's slightly slower, and usually quite more messy to code than a depth sorting algorithm. Also, visible surface determination becomes an integral part of the polygon drawing routine in most cases, making it hard to download the polygon drawing code to some hardware, or to make several versions of polygon drawing code for different drawing modes.
