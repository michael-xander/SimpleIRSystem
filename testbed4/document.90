Binary Space Partitioning
Let us assume we have the description of a scene. Let us cut the scene with a plane P. (That is, choose a plane that splits the scene into two halves.) The crucial point in BSP is that anything on the same side of the plane P as the observer can not be obscured by anything on the other side of the plane P. Therefore, if we can split the space with a plane P in a side A, in which the camera lies, and a side B, which is the other side, then we can draw everything in B then everything in A, and the drawing order between objects in B and A will be correct. Note that we still need to somehow determine what is the correct order within B and A.

In the example above, we show the partitioning plane P with a dotted line, objects are rectangles and ellipses, and the two areas are marked A and B. The observer is the dark spot marked "observer". In this case, objects 1 and 2 are on the "A" side of the P plane, therefore it is impossible for them to be obscured by any object in the B side (namely objects 3 and 4). This is true no matter where in A the observer lies. The observer can be anywhere in the A region and objects 1 and 2 will never be obscured by objects 3 and 4 for the observer.
However this is still not sufficient. We still need to have a drawing order for objects in the A region and objects in the B region. Therefore, we recurse the algorithm and split the A region into two sub regions for which the ordering becomes unambiguous and similarly for the B region, as seen below:
Observer1

Now there are four regions, A, B, C and D. Space is partitioned at the root by P. Then, the two resulting subspaces are partitioned by p1 and p2. This can be represented by the following tree:
When we want to get a drawing order for objects 1, 2, 3 and 4, we traverse the tree as follows:
a) Start with the root P, find on which side of the plane the observer lies. That is the AB side. The opposite side is the CD side. So first, draw the CD side, then the AB side.
b) Draw CD side. Find on which side of p2 the observer lies. The observer is on the C side of p2, the opposite side is D. So first draw D then draw C.

c) The D side has only one object, draw it (so we draw object 4 first)
d) The C side has only one object, draw it (the second object we draw is object 3)
e) Draw the AB side. Find on which side of p1 the observer lies. The observer is on the A side of p1, so first draw the B side then the A side.
f) The B side has only one object, so draw it (the third object we draw is object 1)
g) The A side has only one object, so draw it (the last object we draw is object 2)
The drawing order generated by this algorithm is therefore 4,3,1,2. This ordering is correct.
Sometimes it might be impossible to find a plane that neatly splits space into two sections. When this happens, you can just pick any plane and slice objects apart with it. That is, if a plane intersects an object, slice the object into two sub-objects that do not intersect the splitting plane.
If we have a planar object that is exactly on the splitting plane, then the drawing order can be tweaked slightly to draw it:
1) Draw everything that's on the opposite side of the plane from the observer as usual
2) Draw everything that's on the plane
3) Draw everything that's on the same side of the plane as the observer as usual
If the observer is on the splitting plane, the drawing order is not important.
For polyhedral objects, this can be used efficiently as follows. Instead of arbitrarily picking planes and splitting space, pick a polygon's plane as partitioning plane.
When generating a BSP, you get a binary tree representation of your scene. If you used the planes of the polygons as partitioning planes, you have an additional mild bonus. The leafs of the tree are either inside the polyhedron or outside. That is, the regions in space described by the leafs of the tree are either totally outside the polyhedron or totally inside it. This can be used for simple collision detection of polyhedron with points, even though it is not always efficient to do so. (Efficient collision detection is beyond the scope of this text. For a good starting point, see [4]).

All this brings up the subject of generating an optimal BSP tree. There are many problems with that. The first is the definition of optimal. In the collision detection case (which is not too efficient anyway, but deserves mention), optimal often means shallowest tree. For visible surface determination, minimizing the number of triangle clipping is important, as well as minimizing the number of nodes (which is a consequence of clipping). In both cases, the problem turns out to be extremely hard (NP-Hard). In the "minimizing the tree depth" field, a greedy algorithm that picks the plane that splits space as evenly as possible might do well. However, when trying to minimize the number of polygon clips, it's harder to get good heuristics.
Merging BSP trees is also a very tough problem. Basically it's at least as hard as generating a new BSP tree from scratch. However, it is possible to cut corners.
If we have a very large maze-like scene (for example), and a small object navigating through it, we can do as follows. We treat the small object as a point, just like the observer, and traverse the BSP tree of the maze scene to find where the "punctual" object belongs in the BSP tree. Once we have found it, we insert the "punctual" object's BSP tree at that point in the maze BSP tree. This will work relatively well so long as the small object dos not come close enough to corners in walls to cause ambiguities in the display ordering.
It is also possible to insert several objects this way in the maze BSP.
This algorithm can be very efficient if we have many objects spread over a large area where inter object ordering can be determined easily, but the objects themselves are complex so intra object visual surface determination is nontrivial.
Note that a BSP can be processed through an affine transform and still remain valid if proper care is taken. This means that we can move a binary space partitioned object around, or we can move the observer in the BSP object (these two are equivalent anyway) without fear of the algorithm crumbling. Therefore, it is possible to have a few flying BSP objects at the same
