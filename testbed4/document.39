 Since all occlusion culling techniques are based on exploiting
spatial coherence, first a hierarchy must be generated
for a given scene. The type of hierarchy depends on the
requirements of the application, e.g. whether the scene is
mainly static or fully dynamic. In our tests we used the p-
HBVO algorithm [MBH_01] since our models were static.
As required for any hardware occlusion culling technique,
this scene hierarchy is traversed in a front to back order,
while issuing occlusion queries. Note that sorting and traversal
do not slow down rendering, since they are performed

on the otherwise almost idle CPU. In contrast to Bittner et
al. [BWPP04] we consider the characteristics of the graphics
hardware and perform a cost/benefit balancing to amortize
the cost of wasted queries over time. In addition, we do
not only issue queries for termination nodes, but consider
nodes on all levels of the hierarchy to find the optimal balance
between query time and expected speedup. This also
means that unlike the CHC method multiple queries can be
issued for a subtree in case previous queries did not succeed
but subsequent queries are still reasonable according to the
heuristic. Additionally it also allows using the query result
for a performance gain already in the current frame. Figure 4
shows the pseudo-code for the traversal algorithm.
Table 4 shows the average and minimum frame rates
achieved when using view frustum culling only (VFC), coherent
hierarchical culling (CHC) [BWPP04], the proposed
method (NOHC) and the theoretically optimal algorithm that
only queries occluded nodes for which issuing a query is
faster than simply rendering them. In addition, a node is
not queried if querying the children is faster. Comparing
to this theoretical algorithm gives the overhead required for
the wasted queries using the CHC algorithm and thus shows
how much it is reduced with our approach. The results in Table
4 were obtained using the latest (as of April 2006) drivers
both for ATI and nVidia cards. In addition to using different
graphics cards, we also tested the method using two driver
performance/quality settings, where the maximum performance
setting means no anti-aliasing, no anisotropic filtering
and only bilinear texture filtering (no mip-mapping) and
the high quality setting refers to maximum anti-aliasing,
