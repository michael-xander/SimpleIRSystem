Deep learning (deep structured learning, hierarchical learning or deep machine learning) is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model high-level abstractions in data by using multiple processing layers, with complex structures or otherwise, composed of multiple non-linear transformations. Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning representations of data. An observation (e.g., an image) can be represented in many ways such as a vector of intensity values per pixel, or in a more abstract way as a set of edges, regions of particular shape, etc. Some representations are better than others at simplifying the learning task (e.g., face recognition or facial expression recognition) from examples. One of the promises of deep learning is replacing handcrafted features with efficient algorithms for unsupervised or semi-supervised feature learning and hierarchical feature extraction. Research in this area attempts to make better representations and create models to learn these representations from large-scale unlabeled data. Some of the representations are inspired by advances in neuroscience and are loosely based on interpretation of information processing and communication patterns in a nervous system, such as neural coding which attempts to define a relationship between various stimuli and associated neuronal responses in the brain. Various deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, convolutional deep neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks have been applied to fields like computer vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition and bioinformatics where they have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results on various tasks. Deep learning has been characterized as a buzzword, or a rebranding of neural networks. == Introduction == === Definitions === There are a number of ways that the field of deep learning has been characterized. For example, in 1986, Rina Dechter introduced the concepts of first order deep learning and second order deep learning in the context of constraint satisfaction. Later, deep learning was characterized as a class of machine learning algorithms that use a cascade of many layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation. Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input. The algorithms may be supervised or unsupervised and applications include pattern analysis (unsupervised) and classification (supervised). are based on the (unsupervised) learning of multiple levels of features or representations of the data. Higher level features are derived from lower level features to form a hierarchical representation. are part of the broader machine learning field of learning representations of data. learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction; the levels form a hierarchy of concepts. These definitions have in common (1) multiple layers of nonlinear processing units and (2) the supervised or unsupervised learning of feature representations in each layer, with the layers forming a hierarchy from low-level to high-level features. The composition of a layer of nonlinear processing units used in a deep learning algorithm depends on the problem to be solved. Layers that have been used in deep learning include hidden layers of an artificial neural network and sets of complicated propositional formulas. They may also include latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in Deep Belief Networks and Deep Boltzmann Machines. Deep learning algorithms transform their inputs through more layers than shallow learning algorithms. At each layer, the signal is transformed by a processing unit, like an artificial neuron, whose parameters are 'learned' through training. A chain of transformations from input to output is a credit assignment path (CAP). CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output and may vary in length. For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs, and thus the depth of the network, is the number of hidden layers plus one (the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP is potentially unlimited in length. There is no universally agreed upon threshold of depth dividing shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers in the field agree that deep learning has multiple nonlinear layers (CAP > 2) and Schmidhuber considers CAP > 10 to be very deep learning. === Fundamental concepts === Deep learning algorithms are based on distributed representations. The underlying assumption behind distributed representations is that observed data are generated by the interactions of factors organized in layers. Deep learning adds the assumption that these layers of factors correspond to levels of abstraction or composition. Varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can be used to provide different amounts of abstraction. Deep learning exploits this idea of hierarchical explanatory factors where higher level, more abstract concepts are learned from the lower level ones. These architectures are often constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method. Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features are useful for learning. For supervised learning tasks, deep learning methods obviate feature engineering, by translating the data into compact intermediate representations akin to principal components, and derive layered structures which remove redundancy in representation. Many deep learning algorithms are applied to unsupervised learning tasks. This is an important benefit because unlabeled data are usually more abundant than labeled data. Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are neural history compressors and deep belief networks. == Interpretations == Deep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of: Universal approximation theorem or Probabilistic inference. === Universal approximation theorem interpretation === The universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions. In 1989, the first proof was published by George Cybenko for sigmoid activation functions and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik. === Probabilistic interpretation === The probabilistic interpretation derives from the field of machine learning. It features inference, as well as the optimization concepts of training and testing, related to fitting and generalization respectively. More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function. See Deep belief network. The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks. The probabilistic interpretation was introduced and popularized by Geoff Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Yann LeCun and Juergen Schmidhuber. == History == Ukrainian mathematicians Ivakhnenko and Lapa published the first general, working learning algorithm for supervised deep feedforward multilayer perceptrons in 1965. A paper from 1971 already described a deep network with 8 layers trained by the Group method of data handling algorithm which is still popular in the current millennium. These ideas were implemented in a computer identification system "Alpha", which demonstrated the learning process. Other Deep Learning working architectures, specifically those built from artificial neural networks (ANN), date back to the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1980. The ANNs themselves date back even further. The challenge was how to train networks with multiple layers. In 1989, Yann LeCun et al. were able to apply the standard backpropagation algorithm, which had been around as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation since 1970, to a deep neural network with the purpose of recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail. Despite the success of applying the algorithm, the time to train the network on this dataset was approximately 3 days, making it impractical for general use. In 1993, Jürgen Schmidhuber's neural history compressor implemented as an unsupervised stack of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) solved a "Very Deep Learning" task that requires more than 1,000 subsequent layers in an RNN unfolded in time. In 1995, Brendan Frey demonstrated that it was possible to train a network containing six fully connected layers and several hundred hidden units using the wake-sleep algorithm, which was co-developed with Peter Dayan and Geoffrey Hinton. However, training took two days. Many factors contribute to the slow speed, one being the vanishing gradient problem analyzed in 1991 by Sepp Hochreiter. While by 1991 such neural networks were used for recognizing isolated 2-D hand-written digits, recognizing 3-D objects was done by matching 2-D images with a handcrafted 3-D object model. Juyang Weng et al. suggested that a human brain does not use a monolithic 3-D object model, and in 1992 they published Cresceptron, a method for performing 3-D object recognition directly from cluttered scenes. Cresceptron is a cascade of layers similar to Neocognitron. But while Neocognitron required a human programmer to hand-merge features, Cresceptron automatically learned an open number of unsupervised features in each layer, where each feature is represented by a convolution kernel. Cresceptron also segmented each learned object from a cluttered scene through back-analysis through the network. Max-pooling, now often adopted by deep neural networks (e.g. ImageNet tests), was first used in Cresceptron to reduce the position resolution by a factor of (2x2) to 1 through the cascade for better generalization. Despite these advantages, simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and support vector machines (SVMs) were a popular choice in the 1990s and 2000s, because of the computational cost of ANNs at the time, and a great lack of understanding of how the brain autonomously wires its biological networks. In the long history of speech recognition, both shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of artificial neural networks have been explored for many years. But these methods never won over the non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model/Hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively. A number of key difficulties have been methodologically analyzed, including gradient diminishing and weak temporal correlation structure in the neural predictive models. Additional difficulties were the lack of big training data and weaker computing power in these early days. Thus, most speech recognition researchers who understood such barriers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling. An exception was at SRI International in the late 1990s. Funded by the US government's NSA and DARPA, SRI conducted research on deep neural networks in speech and speaker recognition. The speaker recognition team, led by Larry Heck, achieved the first significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing as demonstrated in the 1998 NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Speaker Recognition evaluation and later published in the journal of Speech Communication. While SRI established success with deep neural networks in speaker recognition, they were unsuccessful in demonstrating similar success in speech recognition. Hinton et al. and Deng et al. reviewed part of this recent history about how their collaboration with each other and then with colleagues across four groups (University of Toronto, Microsoft, Google, and IBM) ignited a renaissance of deep feedforward neural networks in speech recognition. Today, however, many aspects of speech recognition have been taken over by a deep learning method called Long short term memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network published by Sepp Hochreiter & Jürgen
