In Disney’s 1982 film Tron, software engineer Kevin Flynn is teleported inside a computer by the evil supercomputer Master Control Program. The camera pans over an endless arena with geometric 3-dimensional floating objects above a white grid. Surrounded by a neon-etched digital world, Flynn looks around and whispers in disbelief: “Wow.”  At the push of a button, a laser rod appears in front of Flynn and he grabs the ends like handle bars. Within a split second, he’s propelled forward and inside a digitized Tron Lightcycle, battling two warriors in an endless maze. Voracious sounds of zooming cars are blaring.
This classic Tron Lightcycle scene was a phenomenal technological achievement in cinema. It marked the first extensive use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) illustrating the background, objects and movement in a feature film. For at least 15 minutes, Tron offered a glimpse into an unnatural world of boundless imagination and altered the way we visualized the world forever.
But who was the first to envision this new world and how did he push the limits that bring mind-bending innovations that pioneered the way to our favorite Hollywood films today, like Avatar, Transformers, Interstellar and countless other computer-generated masterpieces?
