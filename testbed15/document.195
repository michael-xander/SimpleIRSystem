Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) is proving to be an invaluable tool for many companies. The ability to create images using 3D software provides many benefits over traditional photography.

Whilst photography remains the most suitable option for capturing certain images, CGI offers a level of flexibility that can’t be beaten. Many leading car manufacturers and technology companies now turn to CGI instead of photography, utilising its many benefits.

Imagine that you’re preparing to launch a new product. To market your new product you have a new website in the pipeline, brochures and flyers set to go to print, an e-shot and poster campaign primed and ready to promote your product to the masses, but….. the product itself is still being produced on the other side of the world. By using CGI, a true to life image can be created ahead of the physical product. This enables your marketing activity to be taking place without suffering any delays or holdups!

CGI can also be used to create images of concepts and prototypes for market research purposes. It can be integrated with other visual effects to transform a picture. It really does offer a raft of imagery possibilities.

CGI gives added flexibility enabling images to be adapted to showcase all angles. Making changes to a label or colour scheme are simple and straightforward with no need to setup another photo shoot – adding further flexibility as product ranges grow and develop. Imagery is clean, precise and of the highest quality.

Whilst many images still require photography, especially lifestyle shots, CGI in an amazing option with many benefits. Photo shoots can be dependent on many variable factors – weather, lighting, location and more. It can be costly to rearrange or overcome challenges. CGI removes all that risk.

Here at Fever we are working with many of our clients to produce computer generated imagery, showing just how effective this tool can be. Initial costs are not dissimilar to photography costs, so it is an option that should be considered by any business.

We have websites and brochures well underway in preparation to promote products that are yet to be come off the production line. Ensuring that all marketing collateral is prepared ahead of a launch date, means no delays or costly downtime – just a smooth transition to promote products the second they are ready to be supplied.
