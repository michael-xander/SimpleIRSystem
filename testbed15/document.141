It depends what your goal is. If you want to become a developer then you need to read books about programming. I would recommend for that a book or two on OpenGL. You can then experiment with a lot of different techniques (implement them), rendering, modeling, animation, etc. Another "generic" book is Computer Graphics Principles and Practice. This is a good book and a good introduction. Everything else is really specialized (search for PBRT in Google for rendering for example, the book Physically Based Rendering).

If you are looking to be an artist, then you should probably get a few books on using Maya or Blender. There's also some good websites around (Fx Phd, Gnomon, etc.) but they are not free. Scratchapixel is but as you said, it's not finished (btw it's not supposed to be only about rendering, but they don't have the time to work on anything else right now, since this initiative relies on people writing content of their free time).

If you want to be hired as an artist, practice is the best solution. There's tons of tutorials on the web, so get something like Blender or a student version of Maya (free) and try to create content on your own. While I think it's better for new comers to learn a proper programming langage such as C++, Python is also popular among artists and in studios, so maybe you can learn that as well (write script in Python in Maya).

Good luck. It's better to be passionate to get in this industry, as it is quite saturated right now, and wages are far from being good, to the contrary of what many people seem to think (see the recent scandal about the agreement between big studios Disney-ILM-Pixar on artist's wages). Not a very reliable industry. You should also think about game studios.

However, despite all this, CG rocks!
