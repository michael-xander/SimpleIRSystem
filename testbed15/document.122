The phenomena described by Ibn al-Haytham explains why we see objects. Two interesting remarks can be made based on his observations: firstly, without light we cannot see anything and secondly, without objects in our environment, we cannot see light. If we were to travel in intergalactic space, that is what would typically happen. If there is no matter around us, we cannot see anything but darkness even though photons are potentially moving through that space.

Forward Tracing


Figure 1: countless photons emitted by the light source hit the green sphere, but only one will reach the eye's surface.
If we are trying to simulate the light-object interaction process in a computer generated image, then there is another physical phenomena which we need to be aware of. Compared to the total number of rays reflected by an object, only a select few of them will ever reach the surface of our eye. Here is an example. Imagine we have created a light source which emits only one single photon at a time. Now let's examine what happens to that photon. It is emitted from the light source and travels in a straight line path until it hits the surface of our object. Ignoring photon absorption, we can assume the photon is reflected in a random direction. If the photons hits the surface of our eye, we "see" the point where the photon was reflected from (figure 1).


QUESTION FROM A READER: above you claim that "each point on an illuminated area or object radiates (reflects) light rays in every direction." Doesn't this contradict ''random''?

ANSWER: explaining why light is reflected in every possible direction is a off-topic for this particular lesson (one can refer to the lesson on light-matter interaction for a complete explanation). However, to answer your question briefly: yes and no. Of course in nature, a real photon is reflected by a real surface in a very specific direction (and therefore not a random one) defined by the geometry's topology and the photon incoming direction at the point of intersection. The surface of a diffuse object appears smooth if we look at it with our eyes. Although if we look at it with a microscope, we realize that the micro-structure is very complex and not smooth at all. The image on the left is a photograph of paper with different magnification scales. Photons are so small that they are reflected by the micro-features and shapes on the object's surface. If a beam of light hits the surface of this diffuse object, photons contained within the volume of the beam will hit very different parts of the micro-structure and, therefore, will be reflected in lots of different directions. So many, that we say, "every possible direction". If we want to simulate this interaction between the photons and the micro-structure, we shoot rays in random directions, which, statistically speaking, is about the same as if they were reflected in every possible direction.

Sometimes the structure of the material at the macro level is organized in patterns which can cause the surface of an object to reflect light in particular directions. This is described as an anisotropic reflection and will be explained in details in the lesson on light-materials interaction. The macro structure of the material can also be the cause of unusual visual effects such as irridescence which we can observe of butterflies wings for instance.

We can now begin to look at the situation in terms of computer graphics. First, we replace our eyes with an image plane composed of pixels. In this case, the photons emitted will hit one of the many pixels on the image plane, increasing the brightness at that point to a value greater than zero. This process is repeated multiple times until all the pixels are adjusted, creating a computer generated image. This technique is called forward ray-tracing because we follow the path of the photon forward from the light source to the observer.
