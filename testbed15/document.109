Computer Graphics (CG) was first created as a 
visualization tool for scientists and engineers in government 
and corporate research centers such as Bell Labs and Boeing 
in the 1950s. Later the tools would be developed at 
Universities in the 60s and 70s at places such as Ohio State 
University, MIT, University of Utah, Cornell, North Carolina 
and the New York Institute of Technology.	
The early breakthroughs that took place in academic 
centers continued at research centers such as the famous 
Xerox PARC in the 1970¹s. These efforts broke first into 
broadcast video graphics and then major motion pictures in 
the late 70¹s and early 1980¹s. Computer graphic research 
continues today around the world, now joined by the research 
and development departments of entertainment and production 
companies. Companies such as George Lucas¹s Industrial 
Light and Magic are constantly redefining the cutting edge 
of computer graphic technology in order to present the world 
with a new synthetic digital reality.


1940s

	The very first ³computer assisted² graphics began in 
many different unrelated fields around the world. There is a 
very blurred line that is crossed somewhere between 
mechanical and analog computer assisted graphics, and the 
first directly digital computer generated graphics that would 
associate with today as being true ³CG².

The very first radiosity image. 
While at MIT in the 1940s, Professors Parry Moon and 
Domina Eberle Spencer were using their field of applied 
mathematics to calculate highly accurate global lighting 
models which they called ³interflection reflection². The 
illumination algorithms were based on those by H. H. Higbie, 
published in his 1934 book, Lighting Calculations.
Lacking any display or output mechanism, the image 
itself was created by painstakingly selecting Munsel paper 
samples that matched the output data of their mathematical 
model. The paper was cut out and ironed together by hand to 
create the image shown here in print for the first time in 
over 50 years.

(The original image is still hanging in the office of 
Dr. Domina Spencer at the University of Connecticut.)

The images were first presented at the 1946 National 
Technical Conference of the Illuminating Engineering Society 
of North America, and published two years later (in color) in 
the book: Lighting Design by Moon, P., and D. E. Spencer. 
1948. (Addison-Wesley. Cambridge, MA) The book was used for 
many years to teach lighting theory at MIT in the 
architecture curriculum there. Dr. Spencer went on to teach 
at Tufts, Brown, Rhode Island School of Design, and the 
University of Connecticut where she remains active today.
