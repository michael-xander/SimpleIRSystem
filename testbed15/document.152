The music video format has always been a place for experimentation, somewhere that far-flung ideas can be given form and visual expression. Following in that fine tradition, we're happy to premiere Midnight Juggernauts' video for their track "Memorium" from upcoming album Uncanny Valley, due out 9th July. But instead of containing a short film (which is often the case), this music video is a visual documentary on the evolution of CGI from 1951 to the present.

It's a wonderful journey that traces the development of this now standard practice, from its beginnings on military computer systems through its wireframe incarnations to the present day abstractions of Kinect-based graphics. It's a story that's involved the work of many pioneers, from scientists working in computer laboratories to the work of innovators like John Whitney—and the piece serves as a homage to their work.

To find out a bit more about the vid and what inspired it, we fired off some questions to the director of the piece, band member and CGI enthusiast Vincenzi Vandella.

The Creators Project: The video works both as a documentary and as great visuals for the track. What made you want to explore this hybrid form of music video?
Vincent Vendetta: I think music videos should be much more than just a promo clip for a song. I like the idea of their content being intriguing or informative in their own right and seeing how far you can push tangential ideas, though still finding a thread somewhere to keep it cohesive. I've always been heavily into documentary film, and am working on quite a few other long form hybrid projects which have been spanning a few years. I guess there's just more space to explore. 

What made you want to tackle the subject of CGI and its history?
CGI is now embedded in our popular culture and visual language but I don't think younger generations would really be aware of those important formative years, where each new[ly] released trial would represent a new dramatic technological advance. It was an important evolution and a fairly recent one. I think in the future the majority of all films will be completely CGI. Kids will have apps where they punch in a script, click on Al Pacino and Sofia Coppola as photo-realistic CGI actors, press render and you have The Godfather Part 4. This will be an era of quantity over quality. It's inevitable and will be known as Dead Eye Cinema.

Do you feel the history of CGI is unsung?
Computer programmers and the like would be aware of these pioneers, but considering that CGI is an accepted mainstream field driving most blockbuster entertainment these days, as well as other applications, yes I do think its history is relatively unsung. Most [people] probably think it started from Terminator 2 or Tron or Luxo Jnr. The early pioneers included here led the way to a huge revolution.
