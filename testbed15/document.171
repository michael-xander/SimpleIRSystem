Computer-generated imagery is ubiquitous and has infiltrated our everyday entertainment experiences. Most major movies, many TV series and an increasing number of commercials routinely use CGI technology. Far from inhibiting creativity, the technology has clearly helped directors, writers and creatives push new boundaries.

ComputerGeneratedWhile all this has been occurring in entertainment, CGI hasn’t yet made the same revolutionary impact on business. Or has it?

CGI has the potential to completely change established marketing practices. To start, digitizing product portfolios instantly optimizes brand design and marketing. Imagine creating a complete computer-generated product portfolio, allowing the client to implement or change any asset or product in the design or marketing process.

For marketers, the benefits of creating photoreal products and blending those images with real-life material, is compelling in terms of cost-effectiveness and creative possibilities. For example, we have digitized every option for every car within Mercedes-Benz’s entire product portfolio. These images are now used across a vast range of marketing materials from advertisements to online showrooms.

CGI product portfolios will also have more prosaic uses. They will enable brand managers in a global fast-moving consumer goods company to curate and manage the vast range of product design variations across markets worldwide. A hair conditioner variant carrying a particular promotion in a certain market will be instantly retrievable.

Virtual designs are also becoming a pivotal part of new product design and market testing, enabling brand manufacturers to experiment much more fluidly with designs and test consumer reactions at a fraction of the cost. Recreating product portfolios virtually requires technologies and data management techniques that are a far cry from those implemented on films. With billions of image variables in a product range, the challenge is as much about data processing as it is rendering.

CGI product configurators are already established in the automotive sector and are infiltrating a far wider range of markets. Giving consumers access to real-time visualization and customization of products through sophisticated configurators could help pivot mass manufacturing processes to mass customization.

CGI visualization could stimulate a far more profound shift in the world of brand manufacturing. As CGI production software becomes accessible to consumers, it could create a revolution in grass roots design with the consumer able to dream up sophisticated products, design them, and collaborate to test whether there is a market for them.

CGI branches out into many different elements of a consumer’s daily life, whether they know it or not, and here we are beginning to see how the relationship between consumer and CGI could really evolve. The impact of CGI on the consumer is far more than the visual delights of Hollywood; its effects in the worlds of marketing and business are clearly going to make waves
