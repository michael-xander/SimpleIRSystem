Tony DeRose wanders between rows at New York's Museum of Mathematics. In a brightly-colored button-up T-shirt that may be Pixar standard issue, he doesn't look like the stereotype of a scientist. He greets throngs of squirrely, nerdy children and their handlers — parents and grandparents, math and science teachers — as well as their grown-up math nerd counterparts, who came alone or with their friends. One twentysomething has a credit for crowd animation on Cars 2; he's brought his mom. She wants to meet the pioneer whose work lets her son do what he does.

"It's wonderful to see such a diverse crowd," he says. "How many of you have seen a Pixar film?" he asks after taking the podium. The entire room's hands go up. "How many of you have seen three? Five?" He pauses. "How many of you have seen all of them?" Dozens of people raise their hands, maybe a quarter of the room. "Wow," he says. He smiles, to himself and the crowd. This gig is not one bit bad.

ASPIRING ANIMATORS AND GAME DESIGNERS, STUDY YOUR CALCULUS AND COMBINATORICS

The topic of DeRose's lecture is "Math in the Movies." This topic is his job: translating principles of arithmetic, geometry, and algebra into software that renders objects or powers physics engines. This process is much the same at Pixar as it is at other computer animation or video game studios, he explains; part of why he's here is to explain why aspiring animators and game designers need a solid base in mathematics. As Pixar's Senior Scientist, DeRose has more than a solid base: PhD in computer science, specialty in computational physics, a decade as a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington. This is the first instance of the Math Encounters lecture series at MoMath's new campus in midtown Manhattan, but DeRose given a version of this talk many times before, continually updating it as Pixar's technology improves and fans want to hear about the latest films.

Hair, cloth, fluids, and gaseous phenomena like clouds, smoke, and fire all have their own physics at Pixar. These basic engines are then augmented to try to produce specific outcomes. "Simulating water is easy," says DeRose. "What's hard is, how do you make water more directable?" For Brave, DeRose explains, Merida's voluminous, bright red, highly animated curls required building an entirely new physics engine. The studio's animators had to figure out how to make Merida's hair beautiful, expressive, and even more living than lifelike. DeRose and his team of scientists had to engineer a model that makes that animation computationally possible
