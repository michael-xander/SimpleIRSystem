Terminology[edit]
A red–black tree is a special type of binary tree, used in computer science to organize pieces of comparable data, such as text fragments or numbers.
The leaf nodes of red–black trees do not contain data. These leaves need not be explicit in computer memory—a null child pointer can encode the fact that this child is a leaf—but it simplifies some algorithms for operating on red–black trees if the leaves really are explicit nodes. To save memory, sometimes a single sentinel node performs the role of all leaf nodes; all references from internal nodes to leaf nodes then point to the sentinel node.
Red–black trees, like all binary search trees, allow efficient in-order traversal (that is: in the order Left–Root–Right) of their elements. The search-time results from the traversal from root to leaf, and therefore a balanced tree of n nodes, having the least possible tree height, results in O(log n) search time.
Properties[edit]
 
An example of a red–black tree
In addition to the requirements imposed on a binary search tree the following must be satisfied by a red–black tree:[16]
1.	A node is either red or black.
2.	The root is black. This rule is sometimes omitted. Since the root can always be changed from red to black, but not necessarily vice versa, this rule has little effect on analysis.
3.	All leaves (NIL) are black.
4.	If a node is red, then both its children are black.
5.	Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes contains the same number of black nodes. Some definitions: the number of black nodes from the root to a node is the node's black depth; the uniform number of black nodes in all paths from root to the leaves is called the black-height of the red–black tree.[17]
