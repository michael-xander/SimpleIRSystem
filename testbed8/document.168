Overview[edit]
 
Tree rotations are very common internal operations on self-balancing binary trees to keep perfect or near-to-perfect balance.
Most operations on a binary search tree (BST) take time directly proportional to the height of the tree, so it is desirable to keep the height small. A binary tree with height h can contain at most 20+21+иии+2h = 2h+1-1 nodes. It follows that for a tree with n nodes and height h:
 
And that implies:
 .
In other words, the minimum height of a tree with n nodes is log2(n), rounded down; that is,  .[1]
However, the simplest algorithms for BST item insertion may yield a tree with height n in rather common situations. For example, when the items are inserted in sorted key order, the tree degenerates into a linked list with n nodes. The difference in performance between the two situations may be enormous: for n = 1,000,000, for example, the minimum height is  .
If the data items are known ahead of time, the height can be kept small, in the average sense, by adding values in a random order, resulting in a random binary search tree. However, there are many situations (such as online algorithms) where thisrandomization is not viable.
Self-balancing binary trees solve this problem by performing transformations on the tree (such as tree rotations) at key insertion times, in order to keep the height proportional to log2(n). Although a certain overhead is involved, it may be justified in the long run by ensuring fast execution of later operations.
Maintaining the height always at its minimum value   is not always viable; it can be proven that any insertion algorithm which did so would have an excessive overhead.[citation needed] Therefore, most self-balanced BST algorithms keep the height within a constant factor of this lower bound.
In the asymptotic ("Big-O") sense, a self-balancing BST structure containing n items allows the lookup, insertion, and removal of an item in O(log n) worst-case time, and ordered enumeration of all items in O(n) time. For some implementations these are per-operation time bounds, while for others they are amortized bounds over a sequence of operations. These times are asymptotically optimal among all data structures that manipulate the key only through comparisons.
