Since with a single deletion the height of an AVL subtree cannot decrease by more than one, the temporary balance factor of a node will be in the range from -2 to +2.
If the balance factor becomes ±2 then the subtree is unbalanced and needs to be rotated. The various cases of rotations are depicted in section "Insertion".
The whole retracing loop for a deletion looks like this:
 // N is the child of P whose height decreases by 1.
 do {
   // balance_factor(P) has not yet been updated!
   if (N == right_child(P)) { // the right subtree decreases
     if (balance_factor(P) == 1) { // The left column in the picture
       // ==> the temporary balance_factor(P) == 2 ==> rebalancing is required.
       S = left_child(P); // Sibling of N
       B = balance_factor(S);
       if (B == -1) { // Left Right Case
          rotate_left(S); // Reduce to Left Left Case
       }
       // Left Left Case
       rotate_right(P);
       if (B == 0) // (in the picture the small blue (0) at node 4)
         break; // Height does not change: Leave the loop
     }
     if (balance_factor(P) == 0) {
       balance_factor(P) = 1; // N’s height decrease is absorbed at P.
       break; // Leave the loop
     }
     balance_factor(P) = 0; // Height decreases at P
   } else { // N == left_child(P), the child whose height decreases by 1.
     if (balance_factor(P) == -1) { // The right column in the picture
       // ==> the temporary balance_factor(P) == -2 ==> rebalancing is required.
       S = right_child(P); // Sibling of N
       B = balance_factor(S);
       if (B == 1) { // Right Left Case
          rotate_right(S); // Reduce to Right Right Case
       }
       // Right Right Case
       rotate_left(P);
       if (B == 0) // (in the picture the small blue (0) at node 4)
         break; // Height does not change: Leave the loop
     }
     if (balance_factor(P) == 0) {
       balance_factor(P) = -1; // N’s height decrease is absorbed at P.
       break; // Leave the loop
     }
     balance_factor(P) = 0; // Height decreases at P
   }
   N = P;
   P = parent(N);
 } while (P != null); // Possibly up to the root
The retracing can stop if the balance factor becomes ±1 indicating that the height of that subtree has remained unchanged. This can also result from a rotation when the higher child tree has a balance factor of 0.
If the balance factor becomes 0 then the height of the subtree has decreased by one and the retracing needs to continue. This can also result from a rotation.
The time required is O(log n) for lookup, plus a maximum of O(log n) retracing levels on the way back to the root, so the operation can be completed in O(log n) time.
