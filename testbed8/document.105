Basic operations of an AVL tree involve carrying out the same actions as would be carried out on an unbalanced binary search tree, but modifications are followed by zero or more operations called tree rotations, which help to restore the height balance of the subtrees.
Searching[edit]
Searching for a key in an AVL tree can be done the same way as that of a normal unbalanced binary search tree.
Traversal[edit]
Once a node has been found in a balanced tree, the next or previous nodes can be explored in amortized constant time. Some instances of exploring these "nearby" nodes require traversing up to log(n) links (particularly when moving from the rightmost leaf of the root's left subtree to the root or from the root to the leftmost leaf of the root's right subtree; in the example AVL tree, moving from node 14 to the next but onenode 19 takes 4 steps). However, exploring all n nodes of the tree in this manner would use each link exactly twice: one traversal to enter the subtree rooted at that node, another to leave that node's subtree after having explored it. And since there are n-1 links in any tree, the amortized cost is found to be 2×(n-1)/n, or approximately 2.
