The complex case is when both M and C are black. (This can only occur when deleting a black node which has two leaf children, because if the black node M had a black non-leaf child on one side but just a leaf child on the other side, then the count of black nodes on both sides would be different, thus the tree would have been an invalid red–black tree by violation of property 5.) We begin by replacing M with its child C. We will relabel this child C (in its new position) N, and its sibling (its new parent's other child) S. (S was previously the sibling of M.) In the diagrams below, we will also use P for N's new parent (M's old parent), SL for S's left child, and SR for S's right child (S cannot be a leaf because if M and C were black, then P's one subtree which included M counted two black-height and thus P's other subtree which includes S must also count two black-height, which cannot be the case if S is a leaf node).
Notes
1.	The label N will be used to denote the current node (colored black). In the diagrams N carries a blue contour. At the beginning, this is the replacement node and a leaf, but the entire procedure may also be applied recursively to other nodes (see case 3). In between some cases, the roles and labels of the nodes are exchanged, but in each case, every label continues to represent the same node it represented at the beginning of the case.
2.	If a node in the right (target) half of a diagram carries a blue contour it will become the current node in the next iteration and there the other nodes will be newly assigned relative to it. Any color shown in the diagram is either assumed in its case or implied by those assumptions. White represents an arbitrary color (either red or black), but the same in both halves of the diagram.
3.	A numbered triangle represents a subtree of unspecified depth. A black circle atop a triangle means that black-height of subtree is greater by one compared to subtree without this circle.
