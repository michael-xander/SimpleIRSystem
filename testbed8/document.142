In 1972 Rudolf Bayer[4] invented a data structure that was a special order-4 case of a B-tree. These trees maintained all paths from root to leaf with the same number of nodes, creating perfectly balanced trees. However, they were not binary search trees. Bayer called them a "symmetric binary B-tree" in his paper and later they became popular as 2-3-4 trees or just 2-4 trees.[5]
In a 1978 paper, "A Dichromatic Framework for Balanced Trees",[6] Leonidas J. Guibas and Robert Sedgewick derived the red-black tree from the symmetric binary B-tree.[7] The color "red" was chosen because it was the best-looking color produced by the color laser printer available to the authors while working at Xerox PARC.[8] Another response from professor Guibas states that it was because of the red and black pens available to them to draw the trees.[9]
In 1993, Andersson introduced the idea of right leaning tree to simplify insert and delete operations.[10]
In 1999, Okasaki showed how to make insert operation purely functional. Its balance function needed to take care of only 4 unbalanced cases and one default balanced case.[11]
The original algorithm used 8 unbalanced cases, but Cormen et al. (2001) reduced that to 6 unbalanced cases.[2] Sedgewick showed that the insert operation can be implemented in just 46 lines of Java code.[12][13] In 2008, Sedgewick proposed the left-leaning red–black tree, leveraging Andersson's idea that simplified algorithms. Sedgewick originally allowed nodes whose two children are red making his trees more like 2-3-4 trees but later this restriction was added making new trees more like 2-3 trees. Sedgewick implemented the insert algorithm in just 33 lines, significantly shortening his original 46 lines of code.[14][15]
