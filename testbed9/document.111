he Dijkstra됩cholten algorithm (named after Edsger W. Dijkstra and Carel S. Scholten) is an algorithm for detecting termination in a distributed system.[1][2] The algorithm was proposed by Dijkstra and Scholten in 1980.[3]

First, let us consider the case of a simple process graph which is a tree. A distributed computation which is tree-structured is not uncommon. Such a process graph may arise when the computation is strictly a divide-and-conquer type. A node starts the computation and divides the problem in two (or more, usually a multiple of 2) roughly equal parts and distribute those parts to other processors. This process continues recursively until the problems are of sufficiently small size to solve in a single processor.

Algorithm[edit]
The Dijkstra됩cholten algorithm is a tree-based algorithm which can be described by the following:

The initiator of a computation is the root of the tree.
Upon receiving a computational message:
If the receiving process is currently not in the computation: the process joins the tree by becoming a child of the sender of the message. (No acknowledgment message is sent at this point.)
If the receiving process is already in the computation: the process immediately sends an acknowledgment message to the sender of the message.
When a process has no more children and has become idle, the process detaches itself from the tree by sending an acknowledgment message to its tree parent.
Termination occurs when the initiator has no children and has become idle.
Dijkstra됩cholten algorithm for a tree[edit]
For a tree, it is easy to detect termination. When a leaf process determines that it has terminated, it sends a signal to its parent. In general, a process waits for all its children to send signals and then it sends a signal to its parent.
The program terminates when the root receives signals from all its children.
