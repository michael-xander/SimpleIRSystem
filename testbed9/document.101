! A hash table (also called a hash set)
stores objects in an array of Lists
! When we want to access objects, we
convert the hash-code for that object
(which can be any integer value) to an
acceptable array index
! When there are collisions (two
objects with the same index), we place
them into the stored list
! The overall ratio of objects to arraysize
is kept small, so that the lists do
not grow too long
! Whenever the number of objects gets
too large, we increase the array size
and then re-hash, distributing objects
over the new range of indices. 
A HashSet<E> is instantiated with its specific type, and will
then keep a single copy of any input to the add() method
! When we remove( Object o ), the method returns a boolean
that is true if o is in the set, and false otherwise
! A HashMap<K, V> is instantiated with two types: the first
is the key-type, and the second is the value-type
! The key is the thing that is hashed: it can then be used to look up
objects of the value type
! We add objects using put(K key, V value), which stores the
value with an associated key to look it up again
! When we get( K key ), the method returns the associated
value for that key, or null if there is no such key-value pair 
The built-in hashCode()
method for the String class
returns a value computed based
on the (Unicode) integer values
associated with each character
! Although hash collisions are
inevitable, since there is a
(literal) infinite number or
possible String objects, and a
finite number of integers that
the hash-function can return, the
arithmetic is done in such a way
as to keep the values as welldistributed
as possible
