Searches are an important application.
• What other searches have we considered?
• brute force search (with array or linked list)
– O(N)
• binarySearch with a pre-sorted array (not a list!)
– O(log(N))
• Binary Search Trees are also O(log(N)) on
average.
• So why use „em?
– Because sometimes a tree is the more natural structure.
– Because insert and delete are also fast, O(logN). Not true for
arrays.
So It?s a Trade Off
• Array Lists
• O(N) insert
• O(N) delete
• O(N) search (assuming not pre-sorted)
• Linked Lists
• O(1) insert
• O(1) delete
• O(N) search
• Binary Search Tree
• O(log(N)) insert
• O(log(N)) delete
• O(log(N)) search
– on average, but occasionally (rarely) as bad as O(N).
Search Tree Concept
• Every node stores a value.
– Every left subtree (i.e., every node below and to the left) has a
value less than that node.
– Every right subtree has a value greater than that node. How Many Steps Did That Take? • 7 to 3 to 6 to 5. Three steps (after the root). • Will never be worse than the distance from the root to the furthest leaf (height!). • On average splits ~twice at each node So Time To Search? • So double the number of nodes at each layer. • It?s like “doubling the counter variable each time through a for loop.” How long does that take to run?
