Abstract

Background
The objective of most biomedical research is to determine an unbiased estimate of effect for an exposure on an outcome, i.e. to make causal inferences about the exposure. Recent developments in epidemiology have shown that traditional methods of identifying confounding and adjusting for confounding may be inadequate.

Discussion
The traditional methods of adjusting for "potential confounders" may introduce conditional associations and bias rather than minimize it. Although previous published articles have discussed the role of the causal directed acyclic graph approach (DAGs) with respect to confounding, many clinical problems require complicated DAGs and therefore investigators may continue to use traditional practices because they do not have the tools necessary to properly use the DAG approach. The purpose of this manuscript is to demonstrate a simple 6-step approach to the use of DAGs, and also to explain why the method works from a conceptual point of view.

Summary
Using the simple 6-step DAG approach to confounding and selection bias discussed is likely to reduce the degree of bias for the effect estimate in the chosen statistical model.

Background

The objective of most biomedical research, whether experimental or observational, is to predict what will happen to an outcome if the treatment is applied to a group of individuals or if a harmful exposure is removed. In other words, the clinician/policy maker is interested in making causal inferences from the results of a study. The purpose of this manuscript is to demonstrate a simple 6-step algorithm for determining whether a proposed set of covariates would reduce possible sources of bias when assessing the total causal effect of a treatment on an outcome.

There are many nuances to the definition of cause. For the purposes of this manuscript, we define it in counterfactual terms: "Had the exposure differed, the outcome would have differed", where exposure or outcome may be dichotomous (e.g. presence/absence of exposure; occurrence/disappearance of disease) or continuous (e.g. a different value of blood pressure whether blood pressure is exposure or outcome). Further refinements into sufficient, complementary and necessary causes [1] are important but do not alter the essence of the definition. Although the above causal definition is deterministic at the individual level, in almost all practical settings the outcome under the counterfactual condition is unknown. Therefore, researchers are limited to causal inference at the population level (e.g. comparing average risks) [2]. A straightforward explanation of the use of counterfactuals to define cause can be found in [2].

There are many features of a study that can lead to inappropriate causal inference. For the purposes of this discussion, we assume "ideal" processes for the study (i.e. large studies that minimize the risk of a chance unequal distribution of subjects with different prognoses, no information or selection or detection bias, complete follow-up and adherence, no measurement bias, etc). Under "ideal" conditions, inappropriate causal inferences (i.e. biases) are more likely to occur in observational studies compared to randomized trials because some subjects may be exposed to a treatment for a condition specifically because of personal factors that are related to prognosis (figure 1a). Under the conditions described above, most epidemiologists would consider this confounding bias. We recognize that there are several definitions of confounding bias and Greenland and Morgenstern provide an excellent overview of the nuances among the different definitions [3].

Figure 1
The bi-directional arrows in A show the traditional representation of a confounder as being associated with the exposure (X) and outcome. Because confounders must cause (or be a marker for a cause) of both exposure and outcome (see text for rationale based on basic principles), directed acyclic graphs use only unidirectional arrows to show the direction of causation (B).
The traditional approach to confounding is to 'adjust for it' by including certain covariates in a multiple regression model (or by stratification). One common practice is to consider a covariate to be a confounder (and "adjust" for it) if it is associated with the exposure, associated with outcome, and changes the effect estimate when included in the model. According to standard textbooks, additional criteria also need to be applied and the covariate should not be affected by exposure and needs to be an independent cause of the outcome [4]. However, recent advances in epidemiology have proven that even these additional criteria are insufficient. In fact, the methods described above may introduce conditional associations (sometimes called selection bias [5, 6], collider bias [6] and confounding bias [6, 7]; this terminology may be confusing and we prefer the terminology suggested by the structural approach to bias as described later) and create bias where none existed, which is in direct contrast to the objective of eliminating an existing bias [2, 8, 9]. Some published examples include the effectiveness of HIV treatment [10], and why birth weight should not be included as a covariate when examining the causal effects of exposure during pregnancy on perinatal outcomes [11].

One method to help understand whether bias is potentially reduced or increased when conditioning on covariates is the graphical representation of causal effects between variables. In the causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach, an arrow connecting two variables indicates causation; variables with no direct causal association are left unconnected. Therefore the bi-directional arrows in figure 1a are replaced with unidirectional arrows (figure 1b). There are of course situations where each variable may cause the other – the functional disability created by chronic pain may cause depression, and depression may cause chronic pain through diminished pain thresholds. These more complex situations are simplified by understanding that time is a component in the above relationship. Therefore, there is a variable for depression at time 1, chronic pain at time 1, depression at time 2, and chronic pain at time 2; the same construct measured at different times represents distinct variables and must be treated as such.
