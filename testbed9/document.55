Big-O Analysis of Heapsort
Posted 13 November 2009 - 03:04 PM
Hello!
I have an assignment to write a paper analyzing the Big-O notation of a HeapSort class I wrote. I know the notation is nLogn, but I can't seem to find anything to help with breaking it down from there.

The HeapSort works as a combination of a max-heap and a complete binary tree. For the max-heap part, I'm pretty sure that it's the O(n) bit of the analysis, but I don't why. Basically, each node gets compared to its two children a certain number of times, relative to its position in the tree. So in a tree of ten elements, the first one would be compared to its two children once, the tenth one ten times, and the nth one n times. Then in addition, each of those comparisons is followed by logn comparisons until the element falls into place in the tree (if it wasn't on the bottom two rows). And somehow, I'm pretty sure all of that comes out to O(n) comparisons. I have no idea why.

The binary tree part is simpler - the element on top of the heap is switched with the last one, then the new top one is heaped down logn times. So because that happens for each element, it makes nlogn, plus the max-heap equals 2nlogn and just reduces to nlogn.

There you have it, one pitiful confused programmer. I'm happy to post code for any of those parts if it would help, but I warn that it's not much clearer (at least my implementation isn't :) ).

Thank you SOOO much for any help!!!

I make my PhD at MIT can you send me a thesis ?

Seriously Big-O is more than well documented on the net even in Wikipedia

Pbl is right- Wikipedia is your friend. I found it very helpful and descriptive.

Um, ouch.

I wouldn't have come to DIC except as a last resort after several hours all over the place trying to figure it out myself. I understand the HeapSort, and Big O – I just wanted some pointers to bring them together.

Sorry for wasting the forum's time, feel free to close the thread.

Edit: *Finds binary heap wiki page* *Slams forehead* Wow…no idea how I didn't find that before. So sorry. I just now noticed that link – I was looking at Heap and HeapSort but I didn't see the binary version. Apologies!
