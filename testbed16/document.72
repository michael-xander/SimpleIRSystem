Enterprise Cloud Computing

Enterprise Cloud Computing refers to a computing environment residing behind a firewall that delivers software, infrastructure and platform services to an enterprise. Cloud computing also typically delivers Web services, providing access to components that can be easily combined to rapidly create composite web applications to meet the ever changing needs of a business operation. Web services rely on service oriented architecture that provides software developers with interfaces that leverage functionality contained within existing web applications, resulting in reduced web application development time frames and lower software development costs for an enterprise.

ENTERPRISE CLOUD COMPUTING BENEFITS

Enterprise Cloud Computing offers many benefits to an organization, including superior speed and performance for IT resources, more efficient utilization of IT resources, lower IT infrastructure costs, lower IT operational costs and increased capacity to handle peaks in demand for IT resources, like web applications and services. Cloud computing within an enterprise also provides a safer computing environment, through the use of virtual servers, that reduces the threat of an on site intruder attack on the physical storage devices within a data center. Enterprise cloud computing also provides the capacity for flexible data security policies, where security decisions can be made based on a variety of factors including: the user’s role within the enterprise, the user’s current access location, the type of data or application being accessed by the user and the type of device being used.

IMPLEMENTATION OF CLOUD COMPUTING WITHIN AN ENTERPRISE

With Enterprise Cloud Computing, the bottlenecks that typically occur with the configuration, expansion and replacement of traditional on premise IT systems and components can be eliminated, since the IT infrastructure can be expanded or contracted on demand through virtualization. Cloud computing eliminates the typical challenges presented by localized power grid interruptions, physical data loss due to catastrophic events and malicious on site attacks to the IT infrastructure within an organization. The cloud computing framework provides an optimal environment for faster, safer and cheaper delivery of IT services within an enterprise.
