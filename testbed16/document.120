PaaS Examples: Options to Consider


In the modern business environment, there is a growing emphasis on customer-friendly web applications and services. Many businesses today wish to provide a greater level of customer care and support to their clientele using web-developed applications and solutions. But all too often they find the costs of developing and deploying these apps prohibitive.

In recent years, several service providers have sprouted up to mitigate those costs and offer affordable application development. The most prominent among the services offered by these providers is the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model, which provides businesses with an independently maintained platform upon which their web applications can be built, refined and deployed.

There are two prominent types of PaaS:

Public PaaS is delivered by a services provider for building applications. Examples include Salesforce Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Microsoft Azure, and Engine Yard.
Enterprise PaaS is delivered by central IT within an organization to developers and possibly partners and business customers. Enterprise PaaS sits on top of public IaaS, on-premise bare metal, and on-premise virtual machines. Some technology analysts make a distinction between the actual service that central IT is delivering (PaaS) and the software used to deliver that service. For example, Gartner uses the term “cloud-enabled application platform” or CEAP. Examples include Apprenda, VMware- and EMC-owned Pivotal, and Red Hat OpenShift.
