IaaS vs PaaS: Software Platforms & Infrastructures-as-a-Service

Software platforms delivered as services can be divided in two tiers of varying scale:

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
PaaS (Platform as a Service)
Generally speaking, IaaS is more comprehensive, including integration down to the hardware level, whereas PaaS is mostly concerned with software interfacing.

PLATFORM AS A SERVICE

PaaS, or solution stack, offers a more comprehensive approach to the cost effective application deployment need of today’s developers. This service provides the necessary hardware architecture and software framework needed to put an application into service, without having to own, manage and upkeep all the required resources.

The responsibility of maintaining, upgrading, data storing, helper applications and system operating fall into the developer’s hands. Compared to IaaS, the PaaS offers complete solutions for the design, creation, testing and deployment of the client’s application combined with team members connectivity, software configuration management, version control, integration of databases and customer web service. Taking things a step further, Apprenda offers all of the above-mentioned elements in a high data security environment for enterprises.



INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE

IaaS, in comparison to the PaaS, provides equipment for operations, networking, data storage and hardware with the use of the internet, so that the subscriber is no longer confronted with location and purchase costs.

The provider of these computing resources has only the responsibilities of maintaining the hardware running and housing all the devices. In return, the client will pay strictly for the use of the hardware or hardware related services that were accessed. This kind of solution will offer the client the possibility to acquire server/network resources instantly without taking up any space.



PAAS VS. IAAS

Even though the differences between PaaS and IaaS are very clear, there are advantages that weigh in favor of each one of them, depending on the clients necessities. Considering that today’s IT market is heading towards a self-sufficiency future of computing (and by this we mean that providers presently offer more and more complete solutions), the tendency is to incline towards PaaS type of services.
