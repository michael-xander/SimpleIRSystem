Key Research Challenges in Cloud Computing
I am writing this post to summarize the research challenges that, in my view, need to be tackled to realize the full potential of Cloud Computing. These are the open research issues on cloud computing that should be addressed to create better clouds and so to bridge the existing technology gap in order to foster the adoption of cloud computing.

This is an extract from a post that I wrote in the DSA-Research's blog to describe a keynote at the 3rd EU-Japan Symposium on Future Internet and New Generation Networks.

Cloud Aggregation. Research challenges in the aggregation of resources from diverse cloud providers adding additional layers of service management.
Novel architectural models for aggregation of cloud providers
Brokering algorithms for high availability, performance, proximity, legal domains, price, or energy efficiency
Sharing of resources between cloud providers
Networking in the deployment of services across multiple cloud providers
SLA negotiation and management between cloud providers
Additional privacy, security and trust management layers atop providers
Support of context-aware applications
Automatic management of service elasticity
Cloud Management. Research challenges in delivering infrastructure resources on-demand in a multi-tenant, secure, elastic and scalable environment.
Scalable management of network, computing and storage capacity
Scalable orchestration of virtualized resources and data
Placement optimization algorithms for energy efficiency, load balancing, high availability and QoS
Accounting, billing, monitoring and pricing models
Security, privacy and trust issues in the cloud
Energy efficiency models, metrics and tools at system and datacenter levels
Cloud Enablement. Research challenges in enhancing platform infrastructure to support cloud management requirements.
Technologies for virtualization of infrastructure resources
Virtualization of high performance infrastructure components
Autonomic and intelligent management of resources
Implications of Cloud paradigm on networking and storage systems
Support for vertical elasticity
Provision of service related metrics
Cloud Interoperability. Challenges to ensure that the available cloud services can work together and interoperate successfully.
Common and standard interfaces for cloud computing
Portability of virtual appliances across diverse clouds providers
