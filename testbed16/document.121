PaaS FAQ

1. WHAT IS PLATFORM AS A SERVICE (PAAS)?

PaaS is a shared and elastically scalable application development and deployment platform delivered as a service.

2. WHAT ARE SOME COMMON FEATURES OF PAAS?

The PaaS platform typically includes databases and middleware, as well as services to develop, test, deploy, host, and maintain applications within the same integrated development environment (IDE), and service provisioning that allows multiple users to concurrently use the same IDE.

3. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF PAAS?

One major benefit of PaaS is cost reduction, which largely stems from the standardization and consolidation of resources and elimination of redundant work. PaaS can also significantly reduce the amount of time and effort spent on development, deployment, and upgrades. With PaaS, developers can build web applications quickly without installing any tools or software”?and Apprenda’s patching engine makes it even easier to apply patches for bug fixes, small upgrades, and entire application overhauls.

4. WHAT COSTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH PAAS?

PaaS is typically priced on a utility billing model, so users pay only for what they use. Because PaaS provides a complete hardware and software infrastructure, it eliminates the need to invest in hardware or software and offers significant infrastructural savings as well”?although if you’ve already put money into developing infrastructure, you can simply implement Apprenda’s deploy-anywhere PaaS stack on top of it.

5. WHAT TYPES OF ENTERPRISES CAN BENEFIT MOST FROM PAAS?

Development teams who want to speed their applications’ time to market; organizations with high operational costs who want to reduce the administrators needed for a set of applications; enterprises with looking their applications on a common architecture; and organizations that need critical support metrics for usage and chargeback. Any organization that wants to reduce IT costs, reduce the complexity of database elements and operating systems, increase scalability, and improve their quality of service can benefit from PaaS.
