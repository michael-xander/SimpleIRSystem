We at NextHealth Technologies say “YES”

The measure of building an enduring competitive advantage by delivering products and/or services more quickly, less expensively and with better quality is advancing on a daily basis. “Faster, Cheaper, Better” is being reframed as “Speed-to-Value” and demands continuous innovation. Technology leaders are not only expected to foresee change and respond to challenges swiftly but also to understand and align with business initiatives to provide IT solutions that can be developed and deployed in matters of weeks (vs. months or even years). To respond effectively to these challenges, IT leaders are required to consider new approaches.

Cloud computing represents just such a sharp departure from the status quo. Today most companies still own their software and hardware and keep them onsite in data centers. With cloud computing, companies instead lease their digital assets, and the computers, data centers, applications, and databases are hosted elsewhere and accessed remotely.

How important is this shift to cloud computing? According to Andrew Mcfee, who is the co-director of the Initiative on the Digital Economy at the MIT Sloan School of Management, “It’s a sea change—a deep and permanent shift in how computing power is generated and consumed.”

It’s a sea change that is rapidly rolling through the world of IT – it’s estimated that 70% of CIO’s will embrace cloud-first strategy in 2016 (IDC CIO Agenda webinar).

So, what are some of the business benefits of a cloud-first strategy?

Streamlined processes: Get more work done in less time with fewer people.
Reduced operational issues: Utilizing standardized services can significantly reduce issues and defects, increasing business continuity, reducing time spent on operational issues such as maintenance, accessibility, and training.
Better use of resources: The time and resources freed up by moving to cloud computing allows a reprioritization of scarce resources.
Reduced capital expense: Not only are your capital expenses greatly reduced for software, hardware and licenses, but there can also be a shift from CapEx to OpEx from a budgetary perspective.
Increased Efficiency: Services are deployed rapidly and ready for use in a matter of minutes versus the weeks or months it traditionally takes.
How has NextHealth applied cloud-first strategy for greater agility?

In less than four weeks, we rolled out the necessary infrastructure for our SaaS platform (development, quality, and production environments).
We implemented agile application lifecycle management with a globally-distributed development team, facilitating new ways for employees to work, connect and collaborate.
Within 3 months, we built our MVP (minimum viable product) and increased our opportunity to validate and learn very early in the product development cycle.
With greatly reduced maintenance and support of a computing platform, we were able to focus on our primary objective – building a world-class analytical platform.
We’ve kept our operational costs low while at the same time continuing to grow and scale with our customers.
Adopting a cloud-first strategy has been not only beneficial for our business, but essential. We have been able to not only develop our own products and service offerings more quickly and efficiently, but our clients benefit as well with lightening fast speed-to-value with deployments in as little as 90 days. It’s a win-win for everyone.
