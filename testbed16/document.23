Introduction

Google's online apps look rather familiar, and that's no bad thing

In November, Microsoft made a lot of OneDrive users unhappy – the company canned its unlimited storage offering because people were using it as unlimited storage. While the average unlimited user was storing 5.5GB of data, a handful of users were storing more than 75TB (how Microsoft found that out is up for debate). That's not a typo.

Microsoft responded in dramatic fashion. The unlimited option is gone, the service has reverted to its 1TB limit and free storage is being cut from 15GB to 5GB before bringing back to 15GB again early December for existing customers after the user backlash. The camera roll bonus is gone as well.


But it comes with a catch. You need to visit this page and actively claim your free storage again in order not to be affected when the amount of free storage is change.

What's so great about the cloud anyway?

Convenience, in a word. If things live in the cloud you don't need so much local storage, so instead of slow hard disks you can have small and nippy flash storage – which also means better battery life from your devices. It also means you can access your data from wherever you happen to be – on your smartphone, in a hotel business lounge, at home or anywhere else you can get a data connection.

Cloud storage makes everything simpler. Instead of transferring media files to your phone you simply stream MP3s or movies from faraway servers. Instead of copying crucial documents to flash drives or burning them to disc, you stick them in the cloud where they can't be left in the office or on a train.

Even more conveniently, much of this happens automatically – so for example cloud-based music services know when you've bought new music and make it available to all your devices immediately, and cloud-based storage knows when you've updated a file and updates its copy accordingly.

What are the downsides?

The cloud isn't much cop without an internet connection, although most services enable you to download files for times when you won't be able to get online. There are also financial considerations. Cloud services generally have multiple tiers, with a free service for casual use and paid-for offerings for more serious or demanding users.


As we'll discover, there can be big differences between the various providers' prices. And as Microsoft has demonstrated, you can't be confident that the service on offer today is the service you'll be getting next year.

Let's discover what the major cloud providers offer to see what suits you best.
