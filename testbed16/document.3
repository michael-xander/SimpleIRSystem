Microsoft Azure is growing and evolving in a way that customers want and need to use the cloud. Last month, Microsoft announced some phenomenal growth numbers at its Build 2016 event in San Francisco, boasting over 120,000 new Azure customer subscriptions each month.

Understanding the need to help customers secure cloud workloads, we helped lead the way for Azure security by integrating Deep Security as a Service into the Azure Marketplace in July 2015. Now, we’re excited to announce another step forward in simplifying cloud workload security by offering customers new ways to purchase and deploy Deep Security through the Azure Marketplace.

We like to think about it like this: You can now secure workloads in Microsoft Azure when, where and how you want to!

What you want: deployment flexibility for securing Microsoft Azure workloads

This month, we launched Deep Security software as a virtual machine in the Azure Marketplace – you can now pay as you go or bring your own license. This makes it easier for organizations, small and large, to bake security into cloud workloads. You can now purchase Deep Security software through the Azure Marketplace, having it appear on your Azure bill along with the rest of your cloud resource costs. This helps minimize purchasing and procurement headaches, especially for new business projects.

How you want it: what’s the right deployment choice for the business?

Deep Security can be purchased in a number of ways, each with specific benefits that may fit your business needs.

Deep Security as a Service: If you’re looking for something quick to deploy that is less work for your IT team to get up and running, our service is the way to go. It includes the ability to have hourly billing based on the size for the VMs you deploy, helping you to better align your security & cloud workload expenses. Try Deep Security as a Service free for 1 month to see how easy it can be to secure your Azure VMs.

Deep Security Software VM Appliance: If you want to be able to have complete control over Deep Security in your own environment, either for security or compliance reasons (i.e. PCI DSS 3.1), our newest offer is the one for you. It allows you to consume security for your VMs at the rate you want, while giving you full access and control over your Deep Security Manager. See the Marketplace listing here.

And if you’re an existing Deep Security customer, you can leverage your existing (or new) license with Deep Security on Azure marketplace. You can simply use our new bring your own license (BYOL) option, getting you up and running with full integration into Azure and full control. Activate your license on the Microsoft Azure Marketplace now!

Understanding your Azure Security Responsibility

Cloud security doesn’t have to be complicated when you follow the Shared Security Responsibility model. The basic principle is simple: Microsoft will protect the cloud itself (up to and including the hypervisor), while you are responsible for protecting whatever you put into the cloud.

Microsoft provides their Azure customers with robust physical security, network infrastructure, and virtualization layer. Just like data center deployments, you need to put robust security for your workloads in place to protect the operating systems, applications, and sensitive corporate data.

We are actively working with Microsoft to make shared security easier for our customers. Building on our long standing partnership, Trend Micro has been deeply integrated into the Azure Security Center. Azure customers can discover malware vulnerabilities on virtual machines through the Azure Security Center and deploy Deep Security directly from the Azure Marketplace to help address their Shared Security Responsibility and protect workloads from attack.

What’s next?

Trend Micro will continue to innovate around making security a “baked in” part of your overall business strategy, with a focus on helping customers accelerate cloud projects for Azure. We understand that your top priority is your overall growth and success, and security can be an enabler to achieving those goals faster.
