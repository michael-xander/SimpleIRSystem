World Economic Forum Report on Priorities for Industry and Governments to Advance Cloud Computing
In my last post, I recommended the European Commission report on The Future of Cloud Computing to people defining strategies, developing research lines or exploring market opportunities in Cloud Computing. This time I would like to share a new reading recommendation, the World Economic Forum report on Advancing Cloud Computing: What to Do Now?. This report was the main outcome of a two-year study on the Future of Cloud Computing conducted by World Economic Forum and Accenture.

As part of this study, last December I participated in a Cloud Computing Workshop organized in London by World Economic Forum with senior government representatives, industry experts and academics in Europe to capture perspectives on the development, adoption and deployment of Cloud Computing. This private workshop was the final in-person discussion prior to the launch of the recommendations of the study at the Forum's Annual Meeting in Davos in January 2011. This report is one of the inputs of the consultation process on a European Cloud Computing strategy initiated in Davos by Neelie Kroes some months ago.


The report highlights eight action areas that industry and governments need to address:
Explore and Facilitate the Realization of the Benefits of Cloud
Advance the Understanding and Management of Cloud-related Risks
Promote Service Transparency
Enhance Accountability across all Relevant Parties
Ensure Data Portability
Facilitate Interoperability
Accelerate the Adaptation and Harmonization of Regulatory Frameworks Related to Cloud
Provide Sufficient Network Connectivity to Cloud Services
