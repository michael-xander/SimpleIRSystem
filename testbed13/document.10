# Is quantum computing real?

I see lots of research groups spread out in big, well-known universities that
deal with "quantum computing". I keep seeing online about "quantum computing"
will be able to break current cryptographic systems, use super-predictive
algorithms on things that involve a massive amount of data and variables (such
as powerful meteorological predictions months in advance), etc. but all of
this is said in the future tense...  
  
Does quantum computing exist or not?? What do quantum computing researchers do
all day? Do they just contemplate "quantum algorithms" and "quantum
information" in purely theoretical constructs?  
  
I heard a quantum computer was built, called "D-Wave", what does it do, and
how is it used? Can it run any of the "quantum algorithms" so amorously
discussed?  
  
Yes the tone of my questions are kind of negative, but I keep hearing about
the potential of quantum computing like the entire future of humanity will
change, but the status of this field to me is...not really well known to the
public? Do functional quantum computers exist at this moment in time and do
what they're expected to or not?

The Theory is real.  The quantum computers in use are real.  Whether the
actual process will come to exist according to theory has yet to be
determined.  

  
Quantum computing explained: harnessing particle physics to work faster tells
you how it SHOULD work,,, and  How Quantum Computers Work   will tell you how
it Seems to work.  Whether it is real or not is beyond question.  It is a
viable method of doing an incredible amount of computing in a very short span
of time.  Whether we'll be able to make it happen is another story.

It's certainly real, and working quantum computers have been around for well
over a decade. They just aren't the kind of computers the public is interested
in... They are more fundamental and proof of principle type computers. People
have built and used quantum computers to compute things. Computer is a very
broad term that encompasses far more things than the laptops and desktops you
can buy off the internet. Quantum computers are far from being commercialized
in any useful way.  This is where a lot of research is into - how can you make
these computers useful in any practical sense of the word? They tend to
require lots of power, super cooling, vibrational isolation...  There is
currently a lot of physics working against you building a convenient to use
quantum computer. Plus, quantum algorithms need to be developed in order for a
quantum computer to have any benefit over a classical one. Of course, these
are problems that modern day computers once had, but I wouldn't hold your
breath a hand held quantum computer any time in the next couple decades.
Here's a Timeline of quantum computing .  My only understanding of D-wave is
that it is not the kind of quantum computer you are thinking of, but I haven't
really looked into it.

I've heard current quantum computers referred to as physics experiments. This
is pretty accurate. Compared with classical computing, we're likely at a stage
prior to when ENIAC was built. We understand the pieces and now we're trying
to figure out how to put them together at a scale than can solve practical
problems.

D-Wave has built a machine that performs a specialized class of quantum
computing. An analogy would be a classical computer that can add and subtract,
but cannot multiply or branch. If you have the right problem, it's useful. If
you have other common problems, it is not.

Also, the most recent results that I've seen says that D-Wave is faster than
classical computers on certain instances of the D-Wave problem, but it's
impossible to predict which those instances are.

So stay tuned: we're either going to have quantum computers in 20 years or
have learned something interesting to paraphrase Scott Aaronson.

Sure. I bet they've love a pet to parade around town.  
  
I'm not sure how you'd go about doing this but you'd probably start by sending
a letter to some of the heads and let them know how much you hate blacks and
want to join the cause to get them out of America so that "you can make this

I wish.

No, the Democrats are the relatively sane center-right party, with a
sprinkling of old Hubert Humphrey liberals like me who are nostalgic for the
old days.

Being relatively sane is rather easy, due to the current stances of leading
Republicans. It wasn't like that in the old days.
