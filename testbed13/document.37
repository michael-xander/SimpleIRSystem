## Quantum Computing At the Speed of Light?

**Source: **GE Illuminated Minds

Wired technology is now largely a thing of the past. We now use wireless
networks and new for faster computing and communication devices. But where do
we go next? Every day we read another article that suggests the future is
closer than we think. Whether it's artificial intelligence, _robots in the
home_, or technology that will make today's 'supercomputers' as outdated as
the dinosaur.

_Running on information based on light rather than electrons is a huge
advancement towards a future driven by light and LED technology_

When it comes to computing, while networks and Internet speeds may far exceed
what they once were, there are hard limitations and consumers and researchers
are struggling to find systems that can handle today's Big Data processes.

However, for everyday business and consumer technology, 50,000 computers is
unlikely to be a viable solution to our current data saturation. Enter
'quantum computing'.

A recent _Economist article_ explained the emergence of computers that don't
rely on electricity, the flow of electrons and binary 'on-off' bits to process
information. Instead, these machines take advantage of quantum uncertainty, in
which the state of subatomic particles is unclear, meaning that until
observed, they are effectively in two states at once (as in the classic
_Schrodinger's cat_ thought experiment). This utilization of quantum
possibilities essentially sidesteps the speed limitations of current computing
technology.

As for what these particles are actually made of, there are various options:
nitrogen atoms in a diamond lattice, magnetically-gripped calcium ions,
polarised light photons, even the electrical charges in superconductors.
However, given the growing use of light photons in data transmission (e.g. in
fiber-optic internet cables) many researchers see photons as the favorite
option for commercial quantum computing applications.

_Many researchers see photons as the favorite option for commercial quantum
computing applications_

In today's fiber-optic networks, photons carry information at the speed of
light until it reaches the laptop or smartphone connected to the network. At
this point, the data must be 'handed over' to electrons which is all that
current computers can handle. Engineers at the University of Utah are looking
at solutions using light waves._"Light is the fastest thing you can use to
transmit information. But that information has to be converted to electrons
when it comes into your laptop," _lead researcher of the study, Rajesh Menon
says. _"In that conversion, you're slowing things down." _To overcome this
barrier, they have developed an ultracompact beam splitter capable of dividing
the light waves into separate channels of information. This beam splitter in
turn makes it possible for the researchers to develop silicon chips capable of
running on information based on light rather than electrons - a huge
advancement towards a future driven by light and LED technology. Publishing
their research in the journal Nature Photonics, the team hopes to rule out the
need for electron transmission in computing completely.

This is not to say that quantum computers would necessarily download web pages
faster or improve the graphics of computer games. But they would handle
problems of image and speech recognition, and language translation in real-
time. And in terms of handling volumes of data rapidly, they should be perfect
for the Big Data era in which we find ourselves. Hardly surprising then that
giants such as Google, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Microsoft are all hoping to
develop the first commercial quantum computer.

The benefits will also go far beyond faster processing speeds. Researchers
expect that the technology's ability to shuttle photons instead of electrons
will consume far less power, generate less heat, and result in longer battery
life, all while operating at the speed of light. And when these silicon chips
meet LED technology, the implications could be outstanding for smart cities,
whose citizens would reap the benefits of instant data transmission, faster
than the blink of an eye.

_"The vision is to do everything in light"_ Menon says. _"With light,
computing can eventually be millions of times faster [than it is today]."_
