The goal of our group is to implement a quantum computer with superconducting
qubits. There exist many quantum systems that could be used as part of a
quantum computer, but the class of superconducting qubits based on Josephson
junction circuits is one of the most promising. One advantage of these qubits
is the ability to precisely engineer the Hamiltonian of the system, which
includes single qubit design, multiple qubit design, and measurement design.
The superconducting circuit we study is the Persistent-Current Qubit (PC
Qubit).

A fully functional single qubit is the first step towards a quantum computer.
This is why single qubit characterization and the demonstration of single
qubit control is our top priority. One of the hallmarks of a quantum system is
its discrete energy levels, and so characterization always includes a study of
the qubit energy spectra via spectroscopy. Single qubit control is studied by
applying radiation to the qubit and using nanosecond-scale resolution
measurements to watch population transfer between eigenstates.

Just as important as a fully functional qubit is a good way to measure the
qubit. The conventional way of measuring flux qubits is by ramping the bias
current of a DC SQUID magnetometer until a voltage is seen across the DC
SQUID. The qubit state is then inferred from the current at which the switch
to finite voltage takes place. However, strong qubit decoherence can result
due to this readout process. To address this we have experimentally
implemented a resonant readout technique that only requires the readout SQUID
to be biased at low currents along the supercurrent branch. The low current
bias tends to maintain the first-order noise isolation, helping to minimize
the level of decoherence of the qubit. Since the SQUID does not switch to the
voltage state, the number of quasi-particles is also drastically reduced. In
addition, the resonant readout approach utilizes a narrow-band filter that
shields the qubit from broadband noise.

The greatest applications of a quantum computer require thousands of qubits
coherently coupled. To avoid having enormous amounts of room temperature
electronics, as well as the noise they contribute, it would be extremely
advantageous to integrate qubit and control electronics monolithically. Modern
superconducting foundries, such as the one at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, have the
capability of manufacturing classical digital and analog electronics alongside
quantum bits in the same integrated circuit process. We have recently studied
a single Josephson junction coupled inductively to the PC Qubit. When
sufficient dc current is provided, the device acts as a current controlled
oscillator. Utilizing radiation sources directly integrated with qubits
permits individual control radiation for many different qubits with a modest
overhead in room-temperature electronic complexity. The eventual need for very
large-scale control circuitry to control timing and order of operations on
different qubits also has us investigating Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ).
RSFQ is capable of shuttling fundamental quanta of magnetic flux throughout a
microprocessor at clock speeds of 10's of GHz. These magnetic quanta are used
as digital data bits, and can also be used to stimulate the state of the
qubit.

A thorough understanding of the nature of the decoherence present in our
system is another extremely important step towards a quantum computer. Probing
decoherence with Electromagnetically Induced Transparency is a technique we
have mapped from the atomic world to the PC Qubit. The basic idea is that you
utilize three states of the qubit, two meta-stable states 1 and 2, and a
third, shorter-lived state 3, that may spontaneously decay (to other
unmentioned states) at a relatively fast rate R3. A strong "control" microwave
source couples the 2-3 transition, and a weak "probe" microwave source couples
the 1-3 transition. Individually, the microwaves from the probe and control
sources are readily absorbed by the qubit and thus the transmittance of the
radiation through the PC Qubit is quite low. However, when the control and
probe sources are applied simultaneously, destructive quantum interference
between the qubit states involved in the two driven transitions causes the
qubit to become "transparent" to both the probe and control radiation. Thus,
the fields pass through with virtually no absorption. This can serve as a
sensitive probe of decoherence since even the smallest deviations from perfect
destructive interference between the qubit states results in a loss of
transparency.

With the daunting tasks involved with building a large quantum computer, the
ability to do near-term quantum computation is quite attractive. This is why
we have designed schemes to implement the Factorized Quantum Lattice-Gas
Algorithm (FQLGA) for fluid dynamics simulation, as well as a scheme to run
our quantum computer as an Adiabatic Quantum Computer. The FQLGA is the
quantum version of classical lattice-gases. By replacing bits with qubits you
gain an exponential decrease in required memory and the ability to simulate
arbitrarily small viscosities. These advantages are seen with only modest
numbers of qubits, making the implementation foreseeable in the not so far
future. We have demonstrated multiple schemes to implement this algorithm with
the PC Qubit. Adiabatic quantum computation, while mathematically equivalent
to conventional quantum computation, runs by exploiting the ability of
coherent quantum systems to adiabatically follow the ground state of a slowly
changing Hamiltonian. This has great practical interest because encoding a
quantum computation in a single eigenstate, the ground state, offers intrinsic
protection against dephasing and dissipation. We have demonstrated a scalable
superconducting architecture for adiabatic quantum computation that can handle
any class NP problem without requiring interqubit couplings that vary during
the course of the computation. The proposal we have given requires neither
interqubit couplings to extend beyond nearest neighbors nor qubit measurements
to be highly efficient.
