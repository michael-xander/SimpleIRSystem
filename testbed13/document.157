101010: That's the number 42 represented in binary, which is the mathematical
way today's binary computers see every single piece of information flowing
through them, whether it's a stock price, the latest Adele track, or a
calculation to generate an MRI of a tumor. But now IBM believes it's made
progress in developing quantum computers, which don't use binary coding. It is
not overstating the matter to say this really may be the ultimate answer in
computing machines. Quick, mop your brow and don't worry: The science isn't
too hard to grasp and the revolution, when it comes, could rock the world. In
a very good way.

First, a little background: Computers today, everything from the chip
controlling your washing machine cycle to the screen you're reading this on,
rely on binary math to work. This reduces the information in problems you ask
a computer to a counting system based on just "1"s and "0"s. That translates
beautifully into the electronics of a computer circuit: A "1" matches up with
a little burst of electricity, a "0" means none. By shuttling trillions upon
trillions of these pulses, called bits, through tiny silicon circuits and
transistor gates that flip their direction or trigger an ongoing signal, the
chip does math with these ones and zeros. It's a mind-bogglingly complex and
very swift dance that ultimately results in _Angry Birds_ playing on the
screen of your iPad. Or, after kajillions of calculations more in a
supercomputer, it results in a model predicting climate change.

Now, what if instead of simply being able to do math with ones and zeros, a
computer chip could work with bits that included other numbers? You'd have to
design more complex circuitry, for sure, but it means every single one of
those tiny electronic calculations that's happening every millisecond could
tackle more information at once, and would ultimately mean a more powerful
computer that may calculate faster. Got that? Good. Now how about if instead
of a one or a zero, your computer's "bits" could have any one of an infinite
number of values?

That's quantum computing. Essentially this moves way beyond the well-known
physics of electronics, and on into the weird and wonderful world of quantum
physics--where bizarre twists of the laws of the universe mean a "bit" in a
quantum computer could hold both a "1" and a "0" and any other value at the
same time. That means the circuits of a quantum computer could carry out an
incredibly huge number of calculations at the same time, handling more
information at once than you can possibly imagine.

By using some other very strange physics (superconducting materials cooled to
hundreds of degrees below freezing) IBM's research team is trying to build
some of the core components of a quantum computer, and has made big progress.
They're now saying they've made the quantum "bits" of information, also called
qubits, live a lot longer before they essentially get scrambled. They've also
worked out how to speed up the actual quantum computing circuit. IBM's
progress is so impressive that they're now confident a quantum computer could
be made sooner rather than later, perhaps as close as 15 years away.

Whenever it arrives, the world will change.

On a very simple level, this is because instead of asking a supercomputer to
work with endless strings of "1"s and "0"s to calculate all the variables in,
say, a global warming simulation (performing trillions of small math
calculations one after the other to work out the dynamics of the climate over
a period of hours or days) a quantum computer would be able to process much of
the math at the same instant instead of sequentially. Which could reduce the
compute time to a second or less. Which ultimately means better and more
accurate models of the climate. Similar processing tricks could improve
medical imaging, or maybe even simulations of your own particular disease's
spread, which may improve treatment.

And there are many ways this tech would touch your life on an everyday basis,
as well. Tasks like image recognition in Google Goggles or voice recognition
in Apple's Siri rely on whisking your data off to a powerful computer, running
it through a process, and sending you the results back (identifying that photo
of a building as the Eiffel tower, or answering your question about the rain
in Spain). These recognition problems are partly based on how good the
recognition algorithm is, but also on how much time the computer can afford to
spend on your problem. A quantum computer would work so swiftly that there
would be no issues with spending more time trying to accurately understand
your query, meaning we could reach near-perfect image and voice recognition.
Perhaps even in real time, from a video feed. Imagine the sort of augmented
reality tech that that would enable, with a head-up display on your view of
the world constantly delivering relevant info about everything you see.

Then think about security--most encryption systems nowadays rely on clever
math that means they couldn't be cracked even by a supercomputer running for
years. A quantum computer could try every single combination of passwords to
crack the security in a single second, which is pretty terrible news. That's
going to force all sorts of changes with how we protect information, and yet
it could also lead to more secure encryption, made by a quantum computer.
There's also the matter of surveillance: Recognizing every word of every phone
conversation on the planet and identifying every single face on every CCTV
image would defeat all of today's supercomputer power...but maybe a quantum
computer could do it. George Orwell would've loved that. Also on the dark
side, ponder how insurance firms would use or abuse this phenomenal power
("our simulation says it's 75% more plausible the accident was your fault"),
or how worried nations could simulate social dynamics to try to predict crime.

Next, on the lighter side, consider art. Or at least the movies. Look at
computer graphics in films: The computers in render farms that companies like
Pixar use to make _Brave_ take hours to put together a single frame, and that
limits how truly amazing the image can be made. A quantum computer could
tackle a render of today's Pixar movies in a blink of an eye. And that has all
sorts of implications, maybe meaning CGI actors could be even more realistic.

Which leads on to artificial intelligence--a sci-fi promise that's so far been
very difficult to make real, although IBM's Watson has recently wowed
everyone. What if quantum computing suddenly enabled such swift, complex
calculations that a system like Watson or Siri could talk back to you
convincingly, reading the nuances in your voice enough to ask, as a friend
might, if you're a little stressed today and wondering if they could help?

Quantum computers won't necessarily be able to speed up solving every class of
problem you throw at them, but it's undeniable that they'll change modern life
in many ways, at times small, at others great. As for questions on life, the
universe, and everything? Those still require the human element to try to
answer.
