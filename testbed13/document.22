# Grover's search algorithm

**Grover's algorithm** is a quantum algorithm for searching an unsorted database with _N_ entries in _O(N1/2)_ time and using _O(_log_N)_ storage space (see big O notation). It was invented by Lov Grover in 1996.

### Introduction

Classically, searching an unsorted database requires a linear search, which is
_O(N)_ in time. Grover's algorithm, which takes _O(N1/2)_ time, is the fastest
possible quantum algorithm for searching an unsorted database. It provides
"only" a quadratic speedup, unlike other quantum algorithms, which can provide
exponential speedup over their classical counterparts. However, even quadratic
speedup is considerable when _N_ is large.

Like all quantum computer algorithms, Grover's algorithm is probabilistic, in
the sense that it gives the correct answer with high probability. The
probability of failure can be decreased by repeating the algorithm.

### Uses of Grover's algorithm

Although the purpose of Grover's algorithm is usually described as "searching
a database", it may be more accurate to describe it as "inverting a function".
Roughly speaking, if we have a function _y=f(x)_ that can be evaluated on a
quantum computer, Grover's algorithm allows us to calculate _x_ when given
_y_. Inverting a function is related to the searching of a database because we
could come up with a function that produces a particular value of _y_ if _x_
matches a desired entry in a database, and another value of _y_ for other
values of _x_.

Grover's algorithm can also be used for estimating the mean and median of a
set of numbers, and for solving the collision problem. In addition, it can be
used to solve NP-complete problems by performing exhaustive searches over the
set of possible solutions. This would result in a considerable speedup over
classical solutions, even though it does not provide the "holy grail" of a
polynomial-time solution.

Below, we present the basic form of Grover's algorithm, which searches for a
single matching entry. The algorithm can be further optimized if there is more
than one matching entry and the number of matches is known beforehand.

### Setup

Consider an unsorted database with N entries. The algorithm requires an _N_-
dimensional state space _H_, which can be supplied by log_2N_ qubits.

Let us number the database entries by 0, 1, ... (_N_-1). Choose an observable,
_Ω_, acting on _H_, with _N_ distinct eigenvalues whose values are all known.
Each of the eigenstates of _Ω_ encode one of the entries in the database, in a
manner that we will describe. Denote the eigenstates (using bra-ket notation)
as

{∣0⟩, ∣1⟩, ⋯, ∣_N_ − 1⟩}

and the corresponding eigenvalues by

{_λ_0, _λ_1, ⋯, _λ__N_ − 1}

We are provided with a unitary operator, _Uω_, which acts as a subroutine that
compares database entries according to some search criterion. The algorithm
does not specify how this subroutine works, but it must be a _quantum_
subroutine that works with superpositions of states. Furthermore, it must act
specially on one of the eigenstates, |_ω_&gt;, which corresponds to the
database entry matching the search criterion. To be precise, we require _Uω_
to have the following effects:

_U__ω_∣_ω_⟩ =  − ∣_ω_⟩

_U__ω_∣_x_⟩ = ∣_x_⟩  for all _x_ ≠ _ω_

Our goal is to identify this eigenstate |ω&gt;, or equivalently the eigenvalue
ω, that Uω acts specially upon.

### Steps of the algorithm

The steps of Grover's algorithm are as follows:

  1. Initialize the system to the state |s\ranglele = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_x |x\ranglele 
  2. Perform the following "Grover iteration" _r(N)_ times. The function _r(N)_ is described below. 
    1. Apply the operator _U__ω_
    2. Apply the operator _U__s_ = 2∣_s_⟩_l__e_⟨_l__e__s_∣ − _I_.
  3. Perform the measurement Ω. The measurement result will be λω with probability approaching 1 for N&gt;&gt;1\. From λω, ω may be obtained.

### Explanation of the algorithm

Our initial state is

$$|s\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_x |x\rangle$$

Consider the plane spanned by |s&gt; and |ω&gt;. Let |ω×&gt; be a ket in this
plane perpendicular to |ω&gt;. Since |ω&gt; is one of the basis vectors, the
overlap is

$$\langle\omega|s\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$$

In geometric terms, there is an angle (π/2 - θ) between |ω&gt; and |s&gt;,
where θ is given by:

$$\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$$

$$\sin \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$$

The operator Uω is a reflection at the hyperplane orthogonal to |ω&gt;; for
vectors in the plane spanned by |s&gt; and |ω&gt;, it acts as a reflection at
the line through |ω×&gt;. The operator Us is a reflection at the line through
|s&gt;. Therefore, the state vector remains in the plane spanned by |s&gt; and
|ω&gt; after each application of Us and after each application of Uω, and it
is straightforward to check that the operator UsUω of each Grover iteration
step rotates the state vector by an angle of 2θ toward |ω&gt;.

We need to stop when the state vector passes close to |ω&gt;; after this,
subsequent iterations rotate the state vector _away_ from |ω&gt;, reducing the
probability of obtaining the correct answer. The number of times to iterate is
given by _r_. In order to align the state vector exactly with |ω&gt;, we need:

$$\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta = 2 \theta r$$

$$r = \frac{(\frac{\pi}{\theta} - 2)}{4}$$

However, _r_ must be an integer, so generally we can only set _r_ to be the
integer closest to (π/θ - 2)/4. The angle between |ω&gt; and the final state
vector is O(θ), so the probability of obtaining the wrong answer is O(1 -
cos2θ) = O(sin2θ).

For N&gt;&gt;1, θ ≈ N-1/2, so

$$r \rightarrow \frac{\pi \sqrt{N}}{4}$$

Furthermore, the probability of obtaining the wrong answer becomes O(1/N),
which goes to zero for large N.

### Extensions

If, instead of 1 matching entry, there are _k_ matching entries, the same
algorithm works but the number of iterations must be _π(N/k)1/2/4_ instead of
_πN1/2/4_. There are several ways to handle the case if _k_ is unknown. For
example, one could run Grover's algorithm several times, with

$$\pi \frac{N^{1/2}}{4}, \pi \frac{(N/2)^{1/2}}{4}, \pi \frac{(N/4)^{1/2}}{4},
\ldots$$

iterations. For any _k_, one of iterations will find a matching entry with a
sufficiently high probability. The total number of iterations is at most

$$\pi \frac{N^{1/2}}{4} \left( 1+
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots\right)$$

which is still O(_N1/2_).

It is known that Grover's algorithm is optimal. That is, any algorithm that
accesses the database only by using the operator Uω must apply Uω at least as
many times as Grover's algorithm (Bernstein et al., 1997).
