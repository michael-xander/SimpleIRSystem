MIT Physics Department Senior Research Scientist Jagadeesh S. Moodera was one
of the pioneers in the field of spin-polarized magnetic tunnel junctions,
which led to a thousand-fold increase in hard disk storage capacity. Using his
group’s expertise working with atomically thin materials that exhibit exotic
features, Moodera is laying a step-by-step foundation toward a new generation
of quantum computers.

Moodera’s group is making progress toward devices that display resistance-
free, spin-polarized electrical current; memory storage at the level of single
molecules; and capture the elusive paired electron “halves” known as Majorana
fermions, which are sought after as qubits for quantum computing.

This work combines materials that allow the free flow of electrons only on
their surface (topological insulators) with other materials that lose their
resistance to electricity (superconductors). Researchers call mixed layers of
these materials heterostructures. A key goal is to push these effects up from
ultracold temperatures to ordinary temperatures for everyday use.

 “Our group specializes in the growth and understanding the physical phenomena
at the atomic level of any number of exotic combinations of these materials
plus heterostructures with different other materials such as ferromagnetic
layers or superconductors and so on,” Moodera says.

**Hunting Majorana fermions**

Majorana fermions, which can be thought of as a paired “electron halves,” may
lead to creating quantum entanglement believed necessary for quantum
computers. “Our first goal is to look for the Majorana fermions, unambiguously
detect them, and show this is it. It’s been the goal for many people for a
long time. It’s one of those things predicted 80 years ago, and yet to be
shown in a conclusive manner,” Moodera says.

Moodera’s group is searching for these Majorana fermions on the surface of
gold, a phenomenon predicted in 2012 by William and Emma Rogers Professor of
Physics Patrick Lee and Andrew C. Potter PhD ’13. “I have a lot of hope that
it’s going to come up with something very interesting, this particular area is
exotically rich,” Moodera says.

His team reported progress toward this goal in a _Nano Letters_ paper
published on March 4. Postdoc Peng Wei, with fellow Moodera group postdocs
Ferhat Katmis and Cui-Zu Chang, demonstrate that epitaxial (111)-oriented gold
thin films become superconducting when grown on top of superconducting
vanadium film. The vanadium becomes a superconductor below 4 kelvins, which is
hundreds of degrees below room temperature. Tests show that the surface state
of (111)-oriented gold also becomes superconducting, which holds out potential
for this system in the search for Majorana fermions.

Future work will seek to detect Majorana fermions on the ends of
(111)-oriented gold nanowires. “In this kind of nanowire, in principle, we
would expect Majorana fermion states to exist at the end of the nanowire
instead of in the middle,” Wei explains. Moodera says, “We have not discovered
Majorana fermions yet, however, we have made a very nice foundation for that.”
Further results will be published soon.

**Free flowing current**

In a series of 2015 papers, Moodera’s group demonstrated the first reported
truly zero-resistance edge current in the quantum anomalous Hall state of a
topological insulator system, realizing a 1988 prediction by F. Duncan M.
Haldane at Princeton University. The importance of comprehensive achievements
of perfect quantum anomalous Hall state at zero magnetic field as well as the
demonstration of dissipationless chiral edge current in a topological
insulator is well brought out in a _Journal Club for Condensed Matter Physics_
commentary by Harvard University Professor Bertrand I. Halperin, a pioneer in
the field. “In this system, there is a very special edge state. The bulk is
insulating, but the edge is metallic,” says Cui-Zu Chang, lead author of the
_Nature Materials_ paper and _Physical Review Letters_ paper published in
April and July 2015.

“Our group is the first to show a completely dissipationless edge state,
meaning that the resistance for current flow exactly becomes zero when the
quantum state is reached at low temperatures,” Chang says. “If one can realize
this effect, for example, at room temperature, it will be remarkably valuable.
You can use this kind of effect to develop quantum electronics including the
quantum computer,” Chang says. “In this kind of computer, there is minimal
heating effect; the current flow is completely dissipationless; and you can
also communicate over very long distance.”

**New spintronics**

In a 2013 paper with collaborators from Northeastern University, Göttingen
University in Germany and Spence High School in New York, Moodera and MIT
postdoc Bin Li demonstrated a superconducting spin switch in a structure
sandwiching an aluminum layer between europium sulfide layers. In this work,
the intrinsic magnetization of europium sulfide controls superconductivity in
the aluminum layer. The direction of magnetization in europium sulfide can be
reversed, which can thereby switch the aluminum between superconducting and
normal states, making it potentially useful for logic circuits and nonvolatile
memory applications a step in the direction of superconducting spintronics.
These experiments validated a theoretical prediction 50 years ago by French
Nobel Laureate Pierre-Gilles deGennes.

Several years ago Guoxing Miao, then a junior researcher with Moodera,
observed a unique energy profile across a sandwich structure made with
metallic islands confined within two europium sulfide magnetic insulator
barriers. This arrangement of the inherent large energy separation in the nano
islands combined with the large interfacial magnetic field confined at the
interface and the spin selective transmission property of the adjacent
europium sulfide powerfully modifies the two-dimensional electronic
structures. They observed spin-assisted charge transfer across such a device,
generating a spontaneous spin current and voltage. These unique properties can
be practical for controlling spin flows in electronic devices and for energy
harvesting. Published in _Nature Communications_ in April 2014, these were
unexpected fundamental results, Moodera says. Guoxing Miao is an assistant
professor at University of Waterloo and Institute for Quantum Computing in
Canada.

More recently, the researchers paired europium sulfide with graphene, creating
a strong edge current, which they reported March 28 in _Nature Materials_.
“What we find is very exciting,” postdoc Peng Wei, lead author of the paper,
says: “Experiments show a strong magnetic field (more than 14 Tesla)
experienced by graphene originating in the europium sulfide that polarizes the
spins of electrons in the graphene layer without affecting the orbital motion
of the electrons.”

In the device, europium sulfide produces a large field, called a magnetic
exchange field, which raises the energy of spin-up electrons and lowers the
energy of spin-down electrons in graphene and creates an edge current with
spin-up electrons streaming in one direction and spin-down electrons streaming
in the opposite direction. These effects are brought about by the confinement
of electrons in these atomically thin devices, fellow postdoc Ferhat Katmis
explains. At the interface between europium sulfide, which is a magnetic
insulator, and graphene, Peng Wei explains, the graphene can “feel” the huge
exchange field, or internal magnetism, which can reach millions times bigger
than the Earth’s magnetic field, from the europium sulfide. This effect is
potentially useful for spin-based memory and logic devices and possibly
quantum computing.

**Big organic molecules**

Moodera was a guest editor of the July 2014 MRS Bulletin, which highlighted
progress in organic spintronics. Controlling magnetic behavior at the
interface of the materials is again the key element in this approach. By
adding magnetic sensing capability to these large organic molecules (up to
hundreds of atoms per molecule), their magnetic orientation can be switched
back and forth. This work holds promise to serve as photo-switches, color
displays, and information storage units at the molecular level.

These molecules can start out completely non-magnetic, but when they are
placed on the surface of a magnetic material, their behavior changes. “They
share electrons at the interface. These molecules share some of their
electrons into the ferromagnetic layer or the ferromagnetic layer actually
gives out some of its electrons carrying with it the magnetic behavior,”
Moodera explains. Electrons from the magnetic material carry a magnetic
signature, which influences the organic molecule to switch between resistive
and conductive states. This collaborative work between researchers in the
U.S., Germany, and India was published as a _Nature Letter_ paper in 2013.

Moodera and co-inventor Karthik V. Raman PhD ’11 were issued a patent in May
2014 for high-density molecular memory storage. It is one of four patents
issued to Moodera and colleagues.

“We have shown early stages of such a possibility of these molecules being
used for storing information,” Moodera says. “This is what we want to explore.
This will allow us to store information in molecules in the future.” He
projects that molecular storage can increase storage density by 1,000 to
10,000 times compared to current technology. “That gives you an idea of how
powerful it can become,” he says. Organic molecules have other advantages as
well, he says, including lower cost, less energy consumption, flexibility and
more environmentally friendly materials.

“But it’s a very, very huge area, almost untapped direction where many
unprecedented new phenomena might emerge if it can be patiently investigated
fundamentally,” he cautions. Moodera is currently seeking long-term funding
for this research into permanent memory devices using magnetic single
molecules. “It’s a visionary program which means somebody has to be patient,”
Moodera explains. “We are quite capable of doing this here if we get good
support. ... Everything has to be looked at and understood, and then go
further, so there is no set a priori recipe for this!”

**Historic breakthrough**

In 2009, Moodera and two MIT colleagues (the late Robert Meservey and Paul
Tedrow, then group leader) shared the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize
from the American Physical Society with Terunobu Miyazaki from Tohuku
University in Japan for "pioneering work in the field of spin-dependent
tunneling and for the application of these phenomena to the field of
magnetoelectronics (also called spintronics)."

“Jagadeesh Moodera and team were the first to show magnetoresistance from a
magnetic tunnel junction at room temperature — a fundamental discovery that
has enabled rapid growth of data storage capacity. All hard disk drives made
since 2005 have a MTJ as the read sensor,” says Tiffany Santos ’02, PhD ’07, a
former Moodera lab member who now works as a principal research engineer at
HGST in San Francisco. As a materials science undergraduate and then doctoral
student in Moodera's group, Santos explored spin-polarized tunneling in MTJs
made of novel materials such as magnetic semiconductors and organic molecules.
Santos was awarded best thesis prize from the Department of Materials Science
and Engineering both for her BS and PhD theses.

In common bar magnets, which have north and south poles, two magnets are
attracted if opposite poles face, but will repel if the same poles face each
other. Similarly, in a magnetic tunnel junction, the current flow across the
layered materials will behave differently depending on whether the magnetism
of the layers points in the same, or in the opposite, direction — either
resisting the flow of current or enhancing it. This spin tunneling work, which
dates to the 1990s, revealed that pairing two thin magnetic materials
separated by a thin insulator causes electrons to move, or “quantum tunnel,”
through the insulator from one magnet to the other, which is why it is called
a magnetic tunnel junction. “This change in the current flow, very
significant, can be detected very easily,” Moodera says.

Since these magnetic materials are atomically thin, rather than north and
south poles, their magnetism is associated with the up or down spin of
electrons, which is a quantum property, and they are characterized as parallel
when their spins are in alignment, or antiparallel when their spins point in
the opposite directions. “So all you have to do is change from parallel to
anti-parallel orientation, and there you have this beautiful spin sensor, or
spin memory,” Moodera says. “This spin memory is non-volatile; that’s the most
striking thing about it. You can set this particular device in a particular
orientation, leave it alone, after a million years it’ll be still like that;
meaning that the information which is stored here will be permanent.”

Institute Professor Mildred S. Dresselhaus has known Moodera for many years,
initially through his work using magnetic fields for materials research.
Moodera, she says, developed expertise in spin phenomena long before they
became popular topics in science and he has attained similar status in
topological insulators. “His career has been all like that. He works for the
love of science, and he’s not particularly interested in recognition,”
Dresselhaus adds. Although Moodera has never been a faculty member, he works
effectively with students and he finds his own support, she notes. “MIT is a
place that can accommodate people like him,” Dresselhaus says.

**Funding constraints**

Limited funding means the U.S. is in danger of losing its leadership role in
research, Moodera fears. He involves high school students and undergraduates
(nearly 150 so far) in his research, many becoming coauthors in the
publications and patents. “When we tell the young students and postdocs, ‘Oh,
physics is wonderful, you should get into research, you really can discover
many things that are exciting and valuable’, we are not actually telling the
whole story. Despite funding support from National Science Foundation and
Office of Naval Research for our program, there is increasing uncertainty and
pressure to raise research funds. ... With constant struggle for funds, one
spends much time in dealing with these issues. ... We wish there is reliable
and continuous support when the track record is good. Science is like art — if
creative breakthroughs are needed, then the proper support should be there
with long-term vision, with freedom to explore, and without breaks and
uncertainties. When one looks at some of the breakthroughs we have achieved so
far — magnetic tunnel junctions that drives all hard drives in computers,
prototype molecular spin memory, nonvolatile perfect superconducting spin
memory/switch or even the latest totally spin-polarized edge current which is
perfectly dissipationless, evidently the foundations for tomorrow’s cutting
edge technology, isn’t it crystal clear that such a research program be
unequivocally supported to benefit our society?” he asks.

Despite his lab’s prominence in spintronics and topological insulators, making
further progress in the current research environment means he depends on
federal and other outside grants. “If I don’t have funding, I close the shop,”
he says. “Everything moves so fast, you cannot wait for tomorrow. Everything
has to happen today, that’s the unfortunate thing dealing with uncertainty.
It’s a lot of pressure and stress on us, particularly in the last 10 years.
The funding situation has become so volatile that we are kept under the dark
cloud, constantly concerned about what is coming next.”

Yet the situation has not always been so. During a tour of his lab facilities,
Moodera recalls a phone call (over 20 years ago) from an Office of Naval
Research (ONR) program director, Krystl Hathaway, who suggested there was
money available, his work was high-quality, and that he should apply. “That
was when I had only a month or two of funds left to sustain a research
program! So, I said yes! I couldn’t believe it in the beginning,” he recalls.
“I put in a one-page application. In a week’s time she sent me the money to
tidy me out for four months. After that, I put in a real, several-page
proposal for a full grant, and she supported my research program for over 10
years. Two years after this support started, research led to the discovery of
the phenomenon called the tunnel magnetoresistance in 1994-95, which besides
creating a vast new area of research, is also instrumental in the explosion of
unbelievable storage capacity and speed in computer hard drives as we enjoy
today at rock bottom cost. Most notable is that this work was mainly done with
a summer high school intern who later joined MIT [Lisa Kinder, '99] and an
undergraduate [Terrilyn Wong '97].”

Later, when the same program officer was at a Materials Research Society (MRS)
meeting in Boston, she visited Moodera’s lab and noticed the age of a key
piece of thin film equipment used in creating the tunnel magnetoresistance
breakthrough. It was then about 35 years old and had been cobbled together
mostly from salvaged parts. Again she volunteered to provide substantial
funding to build specialized equipment for a technique called molecular beam
epitaxy (MBE), which is used to create ultra-clean thin films, atomic layer by
atomic layer. On vacation in India, Moodera got a phone call from a physics
administrator (the late Margaret O'Meara), telling him Hathaway from ONR was
urgently looking for him. “I came back the next day, and then I spent four
hours writing a proposal, which another two hours later was submitted from
MIT. It all happened in one day essentially, and one week later I got
$350,000, which built our first MBE system,” he says. “It’s a very versatile
system that even after 20 years continues to deliver big results in the growth
and investigation of the field of quantum coherent materials at present. By
carefully planning and optimizing we even got some other critical parts that
we needed for our other equipment in the lab.”

“Dr. Hathaway, and then subsequently Dr. Chagaan Baatar, the new program
director at ONR, were very happy that we produced a lot more things in the new
system. It made a huge difference in our program. So that’s how sometimes it
works out, and fundamental research should be supported if one looks for
breakthroughs!” he says. “People come in and see, 'these people need support'.
So that kind of thing should happen now, I think.”

Funding for basic science has to increase by manyfold, Moodera suggests. “The
future is actually created and defined now. Evidently it’s very important
then. If you don’t invest now, there is no future development. A vision for
fundamental knowledge buildup is strongly eroding in the country now, and thus
needs to be corrected before it reaches the point of no return,” he says.

**Training real scientists**

Moodera has been at MIT for over three decades, where his group is part of the
Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory (which is now under Plasma Science and Fusion
Center) and the Department of Physics. Moodera’s lab equipment ranges from the
newest two-story scanning tunneling microscope that can examine atomic
surfaces and molecules under extreme cold and high magnetic fields to a 1960s’
vintage glass liquid helium cryostat, which still sees frequent use. “It’s not
the equipment. It’s how you think about a problem and solve it, that’s our way
of looking at things. ... We train real scientists here; ones that can really
think, come up with something out of essentially nothing. To start from basic
atoms and molecules and actually build things, completely new and understand
the emerging phenomena; unexpected science can come out of it,” Moodera says.

“This group has solved important physics in ferromagnetism,” postdoc Peng Wei
says. “We actually have very unique equipment that cannot be seen in other
labs.”

A native of Bangalore, India, Moodera plays badminton, ping-pong, and tennis,
and he follows world tennis, soccer, and cricket. With his wife, MIT
Department of Materials Science and Engineering senior lecturer Geetha Berera,
Moodera likes to hike and enjoy nature. His hobbies include gardening and bird
watching.
