At the subatomic level, the physics starts to get weird.

**By:** Genna Buck Metro Published on 

**I  didn’t understand Justin Trudeau’s spiel on quantum computing. What is a quantum computer exactly?   
— Dorothy, Ottawa**

You’re not alone in your confusion, trust me. Quantum computers are still
mostly in the realm of theory. There’s no quantum computer remotely close to
as functional or easy-to-use as your home computer.

But the potential of quantum computing is really exciting, because
conventional computers are nearly as small as they can physically get.  

And super small things (tinier than an atom) and really big things (like a
planet), don’t appear to follow the physical laws that govern our everyday
experience of the world.

In the teeny-tiny quantum sphere, the same object can be in two different
states — both “up” and “down” for example — at the same time. And one thing
can be in two very different places at once, too. (That’s quantum
entanglement).

Ordinary computing comes down to a long string of bits that are in one of two
states,  zero or one. But quantum systems can be in many states at once,
making it possible to do complex calculations with crazy big numbers regular
computers can’t handle.

So, Dorothy, there’s a reason quantum computing is so baffling. It’s not like
anything else we experience — at least, not anything else I can think of.
Quantum stuff makes my head spin, and not in a good way.  

This goes to show how much science can benefit from integrating concepts and
practices from other disciplines, like literature. An exquisite metaphor can
give you an “Aha! I get it!” moment better than any academic paper can.
Literature people: Get on it!
