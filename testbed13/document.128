Quantum computers_ are_ one type of supercomputer: They are expensive, hard to
use, tricky to operate, and can solve problems that you cannot solve in
reasonable time by any other means. Those are the defining qualities of
supercomputers and have been since the vector mainframes of the 1980s.
Contrary to the answer of Justin Eiler, quantum computers exist and are
shipping commercially from D-Wave:  
  
Home  
  
That site has some great explanations about how quantum computers work. You
might also check out the excellent work being done at (shameless plug for my
university, here, but it _is_ the first entry that comes up with a Google
search) the National University of Singapore:  
  
Centre for Quantum Technologies  
  
I think you are asking how quantum computers differ from conventional
computers. Here is one way to think about it. _Analog_ computers were all the
rage up to about the 1950s because they could mimic arithmetic operations with
real physical phenomena, and that was much, much faster than the early digital
computers. But analog computers had the huge drawback of being very
approximate, with answers limited to two or three decimal places in most
cases. They also required considerable cleverness in figuring out what
physical phenomenon would best mimic a math operation like a divide or a
square root or a cosine or whatever. If you could find that analog between a
physical phenomenon and what you wanted to calculate, and did not mind that
the result was a continuously varying value that you could only measure to two
or three decimals, then you could compute very quickly indeed. Because digital
computers were always higher precision and easier to program, and eventually
became fast, most people forgot about analog computing.  
  
Fast-forward 65 years.  
  
Quantum computers are like those old physical analog computers, but **without
the limitation of providing results that are continuous variables and
approximate**. They use nature's own "digitized" states! So _if_ you can find
a mapping between quantum mechanical and something you want to calculate, then
using the physical analogy is ungodly fast and as precisely discrete as a
digital answer. It takes a lot of cleverness to find that mapping, and one of
the most important ones that has been found is Shor's algorithm for integer
factorization. That's is the one that gives the NSA and other institutions the
jitters, because it could bring down our current Diffie-Hellman systems for
encrypting digital data even when the public encryption keys are quite large.
We are gradually adding to the body of knowledge of how to map quantum
mechanical effects to computations we want done.  
  
The other thing that's tricky about quantum computing at present is that it's
a tough engineering task to maintain a quantum bit, or "qubit." It takes
temperatures near absolute zero, and the darn things just don't stay put for
more than a few minutes. But D-Wave's flagship product has 1000 qubits, which
in principle means it could be programmed to solve problems where there are 2
to the 1000th power possible states to be examined, simultaneously. But these
are the early days of the technology, and the fact that it has gotten as far
as it has suggests that quantum computing will be one form of supercomputing
(not the only one) in the future.

Quantum Computation.

Supercomputers use the same general techniques as more familiar personal
computers. The difference is their massive parallelism.  In this case
parallelism means that if a problem can be divided correctly, the
supercomputer can work on the multiple components simultaneously.  Problems
such as weather, structures analysis, aerodynamics,... lend themselves to
being treated as a lattice and can be solved much faster that with a single
processor.  In addition, being a centralized processor lends itself to much
more aggressive refrigeration.  The result is the elements can be operated a
higher power levels leading to additional speed.  
  
There are two varieties of quantum based computers--adiabatic computers and
quantum gate based architectures.  
  
Adiabatic quantum computers use quantum effects to solve fairly specific
optimization problems as encountered in operations research, engineering, and
machine learning.  They have limited use but for their specific areas of
application they are likely faster than supercomputers.  
  
Quantum gate based computers are to a large extent theoretical.  No  examples
exist.  Not even feasibility prototypes.  In theory Quantum gate based quantum
computers can solve some problems with speeds that surpass any currently
available processor.  In a special sense they are massively parallel.  The
special sense is because they depend on quantum phenomena they also exhibit
quantum quirks.  Answers developed cannot always be read out simply.  They
require special procedures which rely on the statistics of their parallel
answers to produce a  numerical answer usable by external clients.  Also their
quantum data is extremely fragile, requiring much of their computer power to
be used for error detection and correction.  
  
Because gate based quantum computers could break cryptographic codes used
today by banks and other financial institutions in minutes vs decades for the
fastest conventional supercomputer and because they could perform tabular
searches in a fraction of the time needed today, they will be important when
developed.  Like other significant advances, seeing how they will impact
technology when they arrive requires a lot of imagination.

There is no rigid definition of what constitutes a supercomputer. In general,
it is a term that is used to designate the most powerful (and expensive)
computers that happen to be around at the particular time.  
  
Thus, the term is relative, and an 1980s supercomputer has little relation to
a 2010s supercomputer.  
  
However, that said, I do like Quora User's answer. Since the 1980s,
supercomputers have all been multiprocessor machines, to achieve parallelism
in the program execution, and what he says is spot on, in that context.

Quantum Mechanics.

A quantum computer can in theory work out problems in parallel as it can
juggle 2^n possibilities at a time.  A super computer needs all 2^n
processors.  So that's a huge advantage for the quantum computer.  But it's
hard to get n quanta up n the air and keep them long enough to get an answer.

Supercomputers are regular (digital) computers with large computational
capcity compared to "regular" computers--but their computations are still
binary.  
  
Quantum computers are a hypothetical (as in, they have not been built)
computer that take advantage of quantum-mechanical states such as
superposition or entanglement. Instead of binary calculations, where any
particular transistor can only be in two states, "Off" or "On," a quantum
computer can theoretically have transistors that are in indeterminate
superimposed states--functionally, any particular quantum bit could be 1, or
0, or simultaneously 1 and 0. Computationally, this is supposed to allow for
greater computational power--however, as no quantum computer has ever been
built, this supposition has never been tested.

Three things, in about this order, affect your height:

  1. Genetics
  2. Diet
  3. Sleep

Many forget about #3, but your body only grows while you're asleep. Eat a
healthy diet: Varied, mostly plants, not too much or too little. Get good
sleep. Get exercise. That's the limit of what you can do.

There are no superfoods, and no food will "make you taller", so reject anybody
