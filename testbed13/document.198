# Google and NASA are exploring quantum computing with the D-Wave 2X

Technology

##  Google and NASA are using a D-Wave 2X quantum computer that’s 100 million
times faster than existing top-end machines

### Quantum computing again? Haven’t we been hearing about this for years?

The idea of trading bits for qubits – which can be a one, zero or both
simultaneously – isn’t new. But for the first time, someone’s making the
concept work on real-world computing problems. Google and NASA have been
studying how quantum systems can advance artificial intelligence and machine
learning, and solve difficult optimisation problems, using hardware from
quantum firm D-Wave. It’s the latter challenge, called quantum annealing,
that’s generating fresh excitement. The researchers are using the D-Wave 2X to
solve the problem, which could help bring quantum computing into the
mainstream.

### So Google didn’t make the hardware?

##

"The 2X is ten feet tall and must be kept at a chilling -273 degrees C."

No, NASA and Google simply have a standing order with the Canadian company to
receive its top-end machines. That’s now the 2X, a quantum computer that’s 100
million times faster than a normal computer. But using a D-Wave machine isn’t
as simple as plugging it in and typing queries. The 2X is ten feet tall and
must be kept at a chilling -273 degrees C. Aside from a supply of liquid
helium to reach such depths of temperature, those hoping to use a quantum
machine must work out how to write algorithms and programs that work with the
system. That’s easier said than done, as NASA notes: “Representing information
in qubits allows the information to be processed in ways that have no
equivalent in classical computing.” We’ve built the machine, now we need to
discover how it works.

### We don’t know how it works?

Intriguingly, there’s long been debate over whether the D-Wave design even
qualifies as a quantum computer, although Google’s research is being seen as
proof that it does use quantum properties to solve problems. One critic, MIT
professor Scott Aaronson, has pointed out that the research reported by Google
does show a 100-million-times speed jump, but he argues it’s an unfair
comparison as it’s against a standard computer running an algorithm designed
specifically for quantum machines. He claimed better results can still be
achieved via “classical” techniques, namely better algorithms on conventional
computers.

### What could this be used for?

If Google and NASA’s work bears fruit, this subset of machine learning and AI
is ideal for optimisation – simply put, figuring out the best way to do
something. For NASA, that could be selecting a flight path to Mars, but it
could be applied to anything from drug modelling to cracking encryption, or
simply revealing the most efficient train route through Europe for a summer
holiday.

### When will quantum computers land on our desktops?

Google called the results “intriguing and very encouraging,” but there are
many more problems to solve before it becomes a “practical technology”. Even
then, it will first find use in labs and industry. We’ll likely access such
power via companies such as Google, which will offer quantum services the way
IBM sells its Watson AI now. Besides, you haven’t got room in your freezer for
a D-Wave 2X.
