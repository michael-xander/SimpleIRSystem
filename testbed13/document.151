**Abstract:**  
Quantum computers are largely hypothetical devices that could perform some
calculations much more rapidly than conventional computers can. They exploit a
property called superposition, which describes a quantum particle's
counterintuitive ability to, in some sense, inhabit more than one physical
state at the same time.

## Advance may make quantum computing more practical: Feedback technique used
on diamond 'qubits' could make quantum computing more practical

Cambridge, MA | Posted on April 7th, 2016

But superposition is fragile, and finding ways to preserve it is one of the
chief obstacles to developing large, general-purpose quantum computers. In
today's Nature, MIT researchers describe a new approach to preserving
superposition in a class of quantum devices built from synthetic diamonds. The
work could ultimately prove an important step toward reliable quantum
computers.  
  
In most engineering fields, the best way to maintain the stability of a
physical system is feedback control. You make a measurement -- the current
trajectory of an airplane, or the temperature of an engine -- and on that
basis produce a control signal that nudges the system back toward its desired
state.  
  
The problem with using this technique to stabilize a quantum system is that
measurement destroys superposition. So quantum-computing researchers have
traditionally had to do without feedback.  
  
"Typically, what people do is to use what's called open-loop control," says
Paola Cappellaro, the Esther and Harold Edgerton Associate Professor of
Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT and senior author on the new paper.
"You decide a priori how to control your system and then apply your controller
and hope for the best -- that you knew enough about your system that the
control you applied will do what you thought it should. Feedback should be
more robust, because it lets you adapt to what's going wrong."  
  
In the Nature paper, Cappellaro and her former PhD student Masashi Hirose, who
graduated last year and is now with McKinsey and Company in Tokyo, describe a
feedback-control system for maintaining quantum superposition that requires no
measurement. "Instead of having a classical controller to implement the
feedback, we now use a quantum controller," Cappellaro explains. "Because the
controller is quantum, I don't need to do a measurement to know what's going
on."  
  
Vacant expression  
  
Cappellaro and Hirose's system uses a so-called nitrogen-vacancy center in
diamond. A pure diamond consists of carbon atoms arranged in a regular
latticework structure. If a carbon nucleus is missing from the lattice where
one would be expected, that's a vacancy. If a nitrogen atom takes the place of
a carbon atom in the lattice, and it happens to be adjacent to a vacancy,
that's a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center.  
  
Associated with every NV center is a group of electrons from the adjacent
atoms, which, like all electrons, have a property called spin that describes
their magnetic orientation. When subjected to a strong magnetic field -- from,
say, a permanent magnet positioned above the diamond -- an NV center's
electronic spin can be up, down, or a quantum superposition of the two. It can
thus represent a quantum bit, or "qubit," which differs from an ordinary
computer bit in its ability to take on not just the values 1 or 0, but both at
the same time.  
  
NV centers have several advantages over other candidate qubits. They're an
intrinsic feature of a physical structure, so they dispense with the complex
hardware for trapping ions or atoms that other approaches require. And NV
centers are natural light emitters, which makes it relatively easy to read
information from them. Indeed, the light particles emitted by an NV center may
themselves be in superposition, so they provide a way to move quantum
information around.  
  
Local control  
  
Like electrons, atomic nuclei have spin, and Cappellaro and Hirose use the
spin state of the nitrogen nucleus to control the NV center's electronic spin.
First, a dose of microwaves puts the electronic spin into superposition. Then
a burst of radio-frequency radiation puts the nitrogen nucleus into a
specified spin state.  
  
A second, lower-power dose of microwaves "entangles" the spins of the nitrogen
nucleus and the NV center, so that they become dependent on each other. At
this point, the NV qubit could, together with other qubits, be enlisted to
perform a computation. But in their experiments, Cappellaro and Hirose were
evaluating a single qubit, so they could test only the most rudimentary
computational operation: the not gate, which flips a bit's value.  
  
Because the spins of the nitrogen nucleus and the NV center are entangled, if
anything goes wrong during the computation, it will be reflected in the spin
of the nitrogen nucleus.  
  
After the computation is performed, a third dose of microwaves -- whose
polarization is rotated relative to that of the second -- disentangles the
nucleus and the NV center. The researchers then subject the system to a final
sequence of microwave exposures. Those exposures are calibrated, however, so
that their effect on the NV center depends on the state of the nitrogen
nucleus. If an error crept in during the computation, the microwaves will
correct it; if not, they'll leave the NV center's state unaltered.  
  
In experiments, the researchers found that, with their feedback-control
system, an NV-center quantum bit would stay in superposition about 1,000 times
as long as it would without it.
