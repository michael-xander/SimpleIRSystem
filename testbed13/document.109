> ## Quantum vs Classical Computation

>

> Quantum Computing is the art of using all the possibilities that the laws of
quantum mechanics give us to solve computational problems. Conventional, or
"Classical" computers (like the one used to build this page) only use a small
subset of these possibilities. In essence, they compute in the same way that
people compute by hand. There are many results about the wonderful things we
would be able to do if only we had a large enough quantum computer. The most
important of these is probably that we would be able to perform simulations of
quantum mechanical processes in physics, chemistry and biology, which will
never come within the range of classical computers. Let's compare some aspects
of classical and quantum computers.

> Information is stored in quantum bits, or _qbits_. A qbit can be in states
labelled _|0}_ and _|1}_, but it can also be in a _superposition_ of these
states, _a|0} + b|1}_, where a and b are complex numbers. If we think of the
state of a qbit as a vector, then superposition of states is just vector
addition.

> For every extra qbit you get, you can store twice as many numbers. For
example, with 3 qbits, you get coefficients for _|000}, |001}, |010}, |011},
|100}, |101}, |110}_ and _|111}_.

> Calculations are done essentially in the same way as by hand. As a result,
the class of problems that can be solved efficiently is the same as the class
that can be solved efficiently by hand. Here "efficiently", refers to the idea
that the evaluation time doesn't grow too quickly with the size of the input.

|

> Calculations are performed by _unitary transformations_ on the state of the
qbits. Combined with the principle of superposition, this creates
possibilities that are not available for hand calculations (see the _QNOT_
example on the right). This translates into more efficient algorithms for a.o.
factoring, searching and simulation of quantum mechanical systems

> **The _QNOT_**  
The classical _NOT_-gate flips its input bit over;  
_NOT(1)=0, NOT(0)=1_.  
The quantum analogue, the _QNOT_ also does this, but it _flips all states in a
superposition at the same time_. So if we start with 3 qbits in the state  
_|000}+|001}+2|010}-|011}-|100}+3i|101}+7|110}_  
and apply _QNOT_ to the first qbit,we get  
_|100}+|101}+2|110}-|111}-|000}+3i|001}+7|010}_.
