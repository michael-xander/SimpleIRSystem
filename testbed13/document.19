#  Canadian prime minister schools journalist in how quantum computing works

As a journalist, I've learned never to assume anything. Don't assume a fact
you've read comes from a reliable source. Don't assume that your readers know
all the details of a complicated topic you're writing. And today I learned you
shouldn't just assume that the leader of your country doesn't have a thorough
knowledge of quantum computing.

* * *

One unsuspecting Canadian journalist was schooled in this topic today during a
press conference at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in
Waterloo, Ontario. During a visit there, Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau pledged that the institute would receive $50 million from the
country's federal government over the next five years, according to the
Huffington Post. He then fielded questions from the press, which is when one
plucky journalist decided to delve into computer science.

Don't just assume that the leader of your country doesn't have a thorough
knowledge of quantum computing

"I was going to ask you to explain quantum computing," he said, as the crowd
chuckled with delight. The reporter then tried to move on, asking something
serious about how Canada is dealing with terrorism, but Trudeau saw an
opportunity to answer a way more fun question for a change. He launched into
the explanation about computing, drawing applause from the crowd. "No, no,
don't interrupt me," the prime minister said over the claps. "When you walk
out of here, you will know more — no, some of you will know far less about
quantum computing — but most of you."

Trudeau then explained how normal computers are binary systems. "There's
either power going through a wire or not. It's either 1 or a 0," he explained.
"What quantum states allow is for more complex information to be encoded into
a single bit." I mean, that all sounds legit to me, but I'll be honest, my
quantum computing knowledge could use some refreshing. I shouldn't just assume
that Trudeau knows what he's talking about. So I consulted our very own
Russell Brandom about how quantum computing works.

Yeah, so Trudeau knows his physics.
