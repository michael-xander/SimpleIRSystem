Many protocols like SSH, OpenPGP, S/MIME, and SSL/TLS rely on RSA encryption
where access to data is secured with two keys. The encryption key is public
and differs from the decryption key which is kept secret. The cryptosystem's
reliability exploits the fact that factoring large primes takes years to do
even for today's fastest supercomputers, so protocols based on RSA have proven
paramount to anything from processing payments to storing classified
intelligence. RSA, however, might become obsolete soon as quantum computer
system become stabler and more efficient. Using only five atoms, a team of
international researchers showed how to factor a prime, albeit a trivial one
for demo purposes. The researchers say there aren't any _physical_
restrictions that might hinder scalability. Theoretically, more atoms could be
added in the process and large primes could be solved at lightning speed. That
doesn't make the_ engineering_ challenges easy, though.

RSA was first described in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In this a**symmetric
cryptography**,  two different but mathematically linked keys, one public and
one private, are used to decrypt a message. The public key, which anyone can
see and use to encrypt a message, is based on the product of two large primes,
and an auxiliary exponential. Multiplying two large primes to an integer is
easy, but determining the original primes that make the product with no other
info is very difficult.

In 1994, Peter Shor, the Morss Professor of Applied Mathematics at MIT, came
up with a quantum algorithm that calculates the prime factors of a large
number, vastly more efficiently than a classical computer. To actually run the
algorithm though a quantum computer would require many qubits or quantum bits.

In conventional computers, operations that transform inputs into outputs work
with bits which can be 0s or 1s. Qubits  are atomic-scale units that can be 0
and 1 at the same time -- a state known as a superposition. What this means is
that a quantum computer can essentially carry out two calculations in
parallel. A system that works with qubits can be not twice but _millions_ of
times faster than a conventional computer.

Previously, scientists designed quantum computers that could factor the number
15 (primes 3 and 5), but these couldn't be scaled to factor larger numbers.
"The difficulty is to implement [the algorithm] in a system that’s
sufficiently isolated that it can stay quantum mechanical for long enough that
you can actually have a chance to do the whole algorithm,”  Isaac Chuang,
professor of physics and professor of electrical engineering and computer
science at MIT.

Chuang and colleagues at MIT and the University of Innsbruck in Austria claim
they not only found a way to make a quantum system scalable, but also more
efficient. Typically, it took 12 qubits to factor the number 15. The
researchers factored the same number using only five qubits or atoms. These
five atoms are held in an ion trap, which removes an electron from each atom
thereby charging it. The system is stabilized by holding the atoms in place
with a magnetic field.

Logic gates operations are performed using laser pulses on four of the atoms,
while the fifth is used to store or extract results. Using the fifth atom to
store information was the brilliant part. "Measuring a qubit knocks it out of
superposition and thereby destroys the information it holds. Restricting the
measurement step to the fifth ion kept the four involved in the computation
from being corrupted," wrote Amy Nordrum in an article  for IEEE.

The number 15, albeit trivial to solve, is the smallest that can meaningfully
demonstrate Shor's algorithm. A working system developed at University of
Innsbruck factored the number with  a confidence exceeding 99 percent, as
reported in the journal _Science_.

>  “In future generations, we foresee it being straightforwardly scalable,
once the apparatus can trap more atoms and more laser beams can control the
pulses,” Chuang says. “We see no physical reason why that is not going to be
in the cards.”

To decrypt a typical  1024-bit key, the same system would need thousands of
qubits or simultaneous laser pulses. This is doable, but highly challenging
and it might take a long time before you can use a quantum computer to break
RSA.

Moreover, many researchers are already aware of the limitations of current
cryptosystem and are preparing for the future: “quantum-resistant public-key
algorithms”.

> "Continued advances in quantum computing will draw broad attention to the
threat it represents to all of today’s widely used public-key cryptosystems –
the cryptography that underlies electronic commerce and secure communications
on the Internet. The security community will begin planning the migration to
new `quantum-resistant’ public-key cryptosystems for which quantum computers
provide no computational advantage," said Brian LaMacchia,  Director, Security
&amp; Cryptography, Microsoft Research.

It's definitely not hype. There's so much we don't know about the quantum
world, but what we do know tells us that the quantum world is amazing.
