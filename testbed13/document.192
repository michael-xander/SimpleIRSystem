# Canada's Trudeau Schools Reporter on Quantum Computing

By  Reuters On 4/16/16 at 9:51 PM

The Internet was abuzz with praise for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
on Saturday after clips showing him schooling a reporter on quantum computing
went viral.

While political opponents learned a lesson about underestimating the
photogenic Trudeau, 44, during last year’s surprise electoral upset, the
unnamed reporter fell into the same trap during an event at a Canadian
university on Friday when he jokingly tested the former teacher's knowledge.

Trudeau’s explanation on quantum computing generated cheers and applause from
the room and set social media abuzz.

"I was like YEAHH I voted for this guy," said a Twitter user with the handle
@smoakoverwatch.

Canadian writer Anakana Schofield tweeted about the reporter's experience:
"This is what teenagers call 'getting owned.'"

The exchange began when the reporter told Trudeau: “Morning, sir, I was going
to ask you to explain quantum computing" but quickly added a question on when
the prime minister expected Canada to resume its mission against Islamic State
militants occupying parts of Iraq and Syria.

Trudeau immediately shot back with an explanation on quantum computers,
explaining how they do not operate on the principles of conventional physics
and are more powerful than current mainstream computers.

“I wish there were more like him,” said a Twitter user with the handle
@tonticologo.

Trudeau addressed Canada’s actions against the Islamic State militants
directly afterward, although he did not announce any new measures.

The son of a former prime minister, Trudeau led his center-left Liberals to a
majority victory in last year’s election with a campaign that emphasized hope
and optimism. His political opponents had attacked him as “just not ready” for
the job, implying his best feature was his hair rather than his intellectual
prowess.
