# NASA, Google reveal quantum computing leap that leaves traditional PCs in
the dust

## In an experiment, a quantum computer outperformed a conventional machine by
100 million times.

The black box sitting at the heart of NASA's Advanced Supercomputing facility
in Silicon Valley isn't much to look at. The size of a garden shed, it's
smaller than a conventional supercomputer, but inside something quite
impressive is happening.

The box is a D-Wave 2X quantum computer, one of the most advanced examples yet
of a new type of computer based on quantum mechanics, which can theoretically
be used to solve complex problems in seconds rather than years.

Quantum computers rely on fundamentally different principles to today's
computers, in which each bit represents either a zero or a one. In quantum
computing, each bit can be both a zero and a one simultaneously. So while
three conventional bits can represent any of eight values (2^3), three qubits,
as they're called, can represent all eight values at once. That means
calculations can theoretically be performed at much higher speeds.

Research is still at the early stages and commercial use could be decades
away, but a team of NASA and Google engineers announced on Tuesday that the
D-Wave computer, running an optimization problem, came up with an answer 100
million times faster than a conventional computer with a single core
processor.

"What a D-Wave machine does in a second" would take a conventional computer
with a single core "10,000 years" to perform a similar task, said Hartmut
Neven, director of engineering at Google, during a news conference held to
announce the result.

The researchers see it as a promising step, but it comes with some caveats --
not the least of which is that the computer was engineered for the specific
optimization task it was tested with.

An optimization problem is one where there are many possible ways to arrive at
a desired outcome. The classic example is a traveling salesman who has to find
the most efficient route to visit a number of towns. As more towns are added,
the number of possible routes increases, and soon there are too many for a
conventional computer to handle in a reasonable amount of time.

Similar problems exist on space missions and in air traffic control modeling
-- both areas to which NASA devotes significant computing resources.

The problem used to test the D-Wave computer had nearly 1,000 such variables.

"NASA has a wide variety of applications that cannot be optimally solved on
traditional supercomputers in a realistic timeframe due to their exponential
complexity, so systems that use quantum effects ... provide an opportunity to
solve such problems," said Rupak Biswas, director of exploration technology at
NASA Ames.

Details of the test were published on Monday by Google in a scientific paper.

The result is an important one for D-Wave Systems, the Vancouver-based start-
up that built the computer. The machine at NASA's Ames Research Center is one
of three that D-Wave has built. Another is at Los Alamos National Laboratory
and the third is owned by Lockheed Martin and used by the University of
Southern California.

When the first results from the D-Wave computer at NASA were published, there
was significant debate about whether the machine was outperforming
conventional computers. But the first-generation system was based on 512
qubits, and it's now been upgraded to 1,097.

The Google research paper hasn't been peer reviewed, so scientists have yet
weigh in on the latest results.
