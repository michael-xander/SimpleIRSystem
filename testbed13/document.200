##  In recent months, scientists have made important strides toward the
amazing and quirky world of quantum computing.

When it comes to data crunching, quantum computers will leave today's fastest
processors in the dust.

For starters, a quantum computer would be able to store more bits of
information in its memory than there are particles in the universe. And where
a conventional silicon-based computer handles one computation at a time in
sequence, a quantum computer would work on millions at once.

That kind of staggering power would give a single quantum computer the ability
to simulate a whole world in a holographic environment, replicate biological
systems to understand diseases and find cures, solve the loads of equations
necessary to create extremely accurate weather forecasting and simulate how
subatomic particles interact, showing fundamentally how everything in the
universe works.

Several quantum computers linked together would make a quantum Internet so
powerful that search engines would respond to queries almost like a human
being, answering questions immediately and in any language.

In recent months, different groups of scientists and engineers have made
important strides toward this amazing new world. They have built machines that
can store quantum particles, control them, observe them and send them over
fiber-optic cables.

For people in the field, it's an exciting time. "We're gradually removing the
stumbling blocks," said Bill Munro, a research scientist at Japanese phone
giant NTT, who has done extensive research into quantum computing. "We've
shown with the initial experiments that (quantum computing) can work."

Some of the most recent work published in this area has come from scientists
at Aalto University in Finland, who have found a way to store quantum
particles, see them and change them.

Like conventional computers, quantum computers work by manipulating bits of
information. In current computers and laptops, the bits are comprised of
electrons, the magnetic fields of metal particles on a disk or the open and
closed circuits on a microchip. They're stored as "0s" or "1s" and long
strings make the binary code that's the essence of every program.

In quantum computers, the bits are actually not physical particles, but units
of information called qubits that describe the state of particles, including
atoms and subatomic particles, such as ions, electrons and photons. For
example, a qubit might be represented by the direction in which an electron
spins or the polarization of a photon of light – that is, how it's oriented.

Qubits can be either a "0" or a "1," or both a "0" and a "1" simultaneously --
a characteristic called superposition, which is what gives a quantum computer
its extraordinary ability to process so much information at once. And like
regular electronic bits, qubits need to be controlled and stored in order to
get a desired input or output. You need some way to interface with them, just
like you need a mouse or a keyboard to interface with the bits in a PC.

a resonator (red) both contained in a cavity that is chilled to just above
absolute zero. Mika Sillanpää, et. al/Aalto University

But there’s a major catch: qubits are easily disturbed by photons of light or
heat or just about anything else in the natural environment. As soon as one
tries to interact with a qubit, its value changes and it can even lose its
crucial superposition characteristic.

In February, Mika Sillanpää and his colleagues at Aalto University reported
that they had found a way to interact with a qubit without messing with its
superposition.

They built a tiny device that simulates the quantum state of a single atom.
Sillanpää calls his device a kind of "artificial atom" (above). It consisted
of a tiny piece of aluminum attached to a bit of sapphire. The scientists
connected this component to a small piece of material capable of vibrating,
called a resonator.

They put both components into a small cavity and cooled them to just above
absolute zero. That turned the aluminum into a superconductor. Superconductors
are known for conducting electricity with no resistance and can also behave as
single atoms, entering a quantum state.

When the aluminum entered a quantum state, its energy made the resonator
vibrate in a particular way. The vibration stored the quantum state
information, or qubit. At the same time, it transferred energy into the
cavity, which emitted a microwave photon that could be detected. It was the
first time anyone had turned a bit of quantum information into a mechanical
motion linking qubits to the outside world. It's like an electron inside a
conventional computer being converted into a pixel of text on a screen.

Silanpää told Discovery News that theoretically, by reversing the steps and
firing a microwave photon at the component, the scientists would be able to
change the quantum state of the artificial atom. A successful experiment
demonstrating this -- next on his list -- would be similar to having a
keyboard that entered new information into a computer.

This kind of link, or interface, between the quirky energy states of quantum
particles and the macro world of tangible computers is necessary if we're ever
going to harness quantum power.

NTT scientist Bill Munro said since the device allowed for reading and writing
qubits, it was a big step toward a useful computing device.

powerful that search engines would respond to queries almost like a human
being.VICTOR HABBICK VISIONS

Meanwhile, at Yale, in January, a team of physicists found a way to observe
qubits without ruining their superposition. Instead of interacting with the
qubits directly, the team took partial measurements of the particle's quantum
state. They still disturbed the qubit, but it was in a known way, so they
could correct for it.

This research goes some way to building quantum computers. But alone, these
machines wouldn't make an Internet; they need to be connected and exchange
information. That's where sending qubits over long distances comes into play.

At the University of Innsbruck, Andreas Stute and his colleagues did this with
ionized atoms. The researchers put a single calcium ion between two highly
reflective mirrors. They hit the ion with a laser, which changed its quantum
state, writing a single qubit of information onto it. They then hit the ion
with a second laser. The ion emitted a photon, which carried the qubit they
wrote down a fiber optic cable.

Last year, a similar experiment, with un-ionized atoms of rubidium, was
conducted at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Germany. Stephan
Ritter, a physicist there, led a group that transmitted the rubidium atom's
quantum state from one "node" of a network to another.

Both sets of experiments are important to building a quantum Internet, as they
demonstrate that qubits can travel long distances.

Making a quantum computer and full-on Internet is still hard -- and still some
years away. But even with the challenges, it's clear that quantum computers
that outperform the familiar electronic ones are coming. It's just a question
of when.

"Many, though not all, of the fundamental questions about whether such
computer are possible in principle have been answered," Munro said. "Now we
can get to real R&amp;D.;"
