#  Models of Quantum Computation

In classical information theory, the concept of the universal computer can be
represented by several equivalent models, corresponding to different
scientific approaches. From a mathematical point of view, a universal computer
is a machine capable of calculating _partial recursive functions_, computer
scientists often use the _Turing machine_ as their favorite model, an electro-
engineer would possibly speak of _logic circuits_ while a programmer certainly
will prefer a _universal programming language_.

As for quantum computation, each of these classical concepts has a quantum
counterpart: [25]

##  
The Mathematical Model of QC

The paradigm of computation as a physical process requires that QC can -- in
principle -- be described by the same means as any other physical reality,
which, for the field of quantum physics, is the mathematical formalism of
Hilbert space operator algebra. The basics of this formalism, as far as they
are relevant to QC, have been the topic of 1.3 and chapter 2.

The moral equivalent in QC to partial recursive functions, the mathematical
concept of classical computability, are unitary operators. As every
classically computable problem can be reformulated as calculating the value of
a partial recursive function, each quantum computation must have a
corresponding unitary operator.

The mathematical description of an operator is inherently declarative; the
actual implementation for a certain quantum architecture i.e. the algorithmic
decomposition into elementary operations, is beyond the scope of this
formalism. Also, since the mathematical model treats unitary operators as
black boxes, no complexity measure is provided.

##  
Quantum Turing Machines

In analogy to the classic Turing Machine (TM) several propositions of Quantum
Turing Machines (QTM), as a model of a universal quantum computer have been
made [3,1].

The complete machine-state  is thereby given by a superposition of base-states
, where  is the inner state of the head,  the head position and  the binary
representation of the tape-content. To keep  separable, the (infinite) bit-
string  has to meet the _zero tail state_ condition i.e. only a finite number
of bits with  are allowed.

The quantum analogon to the transition function of a classic probabilistic TM
is the _step operator_ , which has to be unitary to allow for the existence of
a corresponding Hamiltonian (see 1.3.2.5) and meet locality conditions for the
effected tape-qubit, as well as for head movement.

QTMs provide a measure for execution times, but -- as with the classical TM --
finding an appropriate step operator can be very hard and runtime-complexity
(i.e. the number of applications of  in relation to the problem size) remains
an issue. Outside quantum complexity theory, QTMs are of minor importance.

##  
Quantum Circuits

Quantum circuits are the QC equivalent to classical boolean feed-forward
networks, with one major difference: since all quantum computations have to be
unitary, all quantum circuits can be evaluated in both directions (as with
classical reversible logic). Quantum circuits are composed of elementary gates
and operate on qubits, thus  where  is the (fixed) number of qubits. The
``wiring'' between the gates thereby corresponds to unitary reordering
operators  (see 2.2.1.5).

In comparison with classical boolean feed-forward networks, this imposes the
following restrictions:

  * Only -to- networks are allowed i.e. the total number of inputs has to match the total number of outputs. 
  * Only -to- gates are allowed. 
  * No forking of inputs is allowed. This is directly related to the fact that qubits can't be copied, i.e. that there exists no unitary operation   

|  (2.49)  
---|---  
  

which can turn a general qubit-state into a product state of itself.

  * No ``dead ends'' are allowed. Again, this is because the erasure of a qubit   

|  (2.50)  
---|---  
  

is not a unitary operation.

To allow for implementation of all possible unitary transformations, a
universal set of elementary gates must be available, out of which composed
gates can be constructed (see 2.2.2.3). Each -qubit gate  thereby describes up
to  different unitary transformations , depending on the wiring of the inputs
(see 2.2.2.2).

As opposed to the operator formalism, the gate-notation is an inherently
constructive method and -- other than QTMs -- the complexity of the problem is
directly reflected in the number of gates necessary to implement it.

##  
Quantum Programming Languages

When it comes to programming and the design of non-classic algorithms, we can
look at the mathematical description as the specification and quantum circuits
as the assembly language of QC.

Just as classical programming languages, quantum programming languages (QPLs)
provide a constructive means to specify the sequence of elementary operators,
while allowing nested levels of abstraction.

###  Flow Control

In it's simplest form, a quantum algorithm merely consists of a unitary
transformation and a subsequent measurement of the resulting state. This would
e.g. be the case, if a quantum computer is used to emulate the behavior of
another quantum system.

For more ``traditional'' computational tasks, as e.g. searching or
mathematical calculations, efficient quantum implementations often have the
form of probabilistic algorithms. Figure 2.1 shows the basic outline of a
probabilistic non-classical algorithm with a simple evaluation loop.

**Figure 2.1:** A simple non-classical algorithm

More complex quantum algorithms, as e.g. Shor's algorithm for quantum
factoring (see 4.2), can also include classical random numbers, partial
measurements, nested evaluation loops and multiple termination conditions: The
actual quantum operations as resetting of the machine state, unitary
transformations and measurements are embedded into a classical flow-control
framework.

A formal way to describe the classical control structure, is to consider
quantum operations as special statements within a classical procedural
language. Therefor any QPL also has to be a universal programming language.

###  Operator Specification

Classical procedural languages provide different levels of abstraction by
allowing the grouping of primitives into reusable subroutines (procedures)
which can operate on different data (parameters, references) and use
temporally allocated memory (local variables).

If this concept is to be used for the definition of unitary operators, then
language elements have to be provided which account for the reversibility of
unitary transformation and the non-local nature of entangled quantum bits.

  * **Mathematical Semantics:** The effect of an operator has to be _uniform_ and has to be restricted to the quantum machine state i.e. the use of an operator must not interfere with the classical state of the machine. 

This means that the implementation of an operator must only depend on its
parameters and must not produce any side-effects. This esp. excludes the use
of global variables and the use of non-deterministic functions (such as a
random numbers).

  * **Unitarity:** It has to be assured that operators are restricted to unitary transformation. This excludes non-unitary quantum operations such as measurement. 
  * **Reversibility:** Since for any unitary operator, there exists an inverse adjoint operator, a QPL should provide means to execute operators in reverse. 
  * **Symbolic Registers:** An operator must be able to operate on any set of qubits. This requires the ability to define symbolic quantum registers.
