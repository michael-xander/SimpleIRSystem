# More quantum computing research needed

By STEVEN PARK on April 27, 2016 in OPINIONS \- No comments

In 1965, co-founder of Intel Gordon Moore made a famous prediction: the number
of tran­sistors on a microprocessor chip, and thus its performance, will
continue to double every two years. Widely known as Moore’s law, this bold
claim transformed the semiconductor industry as processor chip manufacturers
rushed to fulfill this prediction every year. While attempts have been
successful for the past 60 years, transistors are now starting to reach their
physical limita­tions and Moore’s law finally seems doomed to fail. But
computer software company D-Wave Systems, Inc. has a solution: if processors
can no longer speed up on a classical level, then why not design processors
that function on a quantum level?

While the topic of quantum mechanics may appear daunting at first, the general
basis be­hind this fascinating science is rather simple. To provide a brief
summary, quantum mechan­ics is a relatively new branch of physics that
fo­cuses on processes happening at an atomic lev­el. It arose when scientists
realized that rules of physics governing the world at a large scale don’t seem
to match the behavior of subatomic particles like electrons and photons. While
ob­jects in classical mechanics exist in a specific place at a specific time,
objects in quantum me­chanics can exist in numerous different places and be
different things at the same time. Ad­ditionally, quantum mechanics isn’t just
con­fined to theoretical physics. Companies that can incorporate this new
variable into their machinery could potentially change the entire industry of
their field, which is ultimately what D-Wave is currently trying to
accomplish.

For the past several decades, the semiconduc­tor industry built faster, more
efficient processor chips by building increasingly smaller transistors. The
idea is that the smaller the transistors are, the more you can squeeze on a
microprocessor chip and the faster the chip can process informa­tion. So far,
the most advanced microprocessors have circuit features that are only 14
nanometers long, which is smaller than the size of most vi­ruses (Nature, “The
chips are down for Moore’s law,” 02.09.2016). Experts estimate that in a few
years, manufacturers may start building tran­sistors that are only 10 atoms
long. But despite the industry’s successful track record, there is a definite
limit to how small a transistor can be be­fore it becomes too unreliable to
use. That is why D-Wave used the bizarre rules of quantum phys­ics to create a
supercomputer that can process data much faster than what classical computing
will ever be capable of. In 2015, the company announced the construction of
the world’s first fully-operational quantum computer, the D-Wave 2X system
(D-Wave, “Meet D-Wave,” 2014).

The big question for most people, however, is how does a quantum computer
work? Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gained huge me­dia buzz on the
internet when he offered his own explanation: “What quantum states allow for
is much more complex information to be encod­ed into a single bit. A regular
computer bit is either a 1 or 0—on or off. A quantum state can be much more
complex than that because as we know, things can be both particle and wave at
the same time and the uncertainty around quantum states allows us to encode
more information into a much smaller computer” (Maclean’s, “Trudeau versus the
experts: Quantum computing in 35 seconds,” 04.19.2016).

Although initially impressive, Trudeau’s ex­planation is not quite correct.
While it is true that conventional computers use bits that are either a 1 or a
0, the quantum states of quantum comput­ers don’t allow more information to be
squeezed into a single bit (The Washington Post, “Actually, Justin Trudeau
doesn’t get quantum computing,” 04.18.2016). A quantum bit, or a qubit, is in
a state of complete mystery until it is measured, at which point, it becomes a
normal 0 or 1. However, what makes quantum computers so powerful is that being
in that state of complete mystery, known as superposition, allows a qubit to
be 0, 1 or both at the same time (D-Wave, “Quantum Computing,” 2014). This
characteristic is what gives quantum computers like the D-Wave system their
most valuable feature: the ability to consider all possi­bilities
simultaneously and choose the best one.

While a classical computer solves a problem by considering each possible
solution one at a time, experts estimate that a quantum computer can process
and solve a problem up to a 100 mil­lion times faster than a conventional
computer (ExtremeTech, “Google: Our quantum computer is 100 million times
faster than a conventional system,” 12.09.2015). Given this extraordinary
speed, it’s little wonder that Google, NASA, Lock­heed Martin and the U.S.
Department of Energy have all showed great interest in D-Wave’s prod­uct (BBC,
“Quantum computing: Game changer or security threat?” 04.05.2016).

Quantum computing allows the tech indus­try to not only meet the predictions
of Moore’s law, but also greatly surpass them. The D-Wave 2X system is
expected to become an irreplace­able asset in solving optimization problems
that require sifting through enormous stockpiles of data. Examples of the
D-Wave computer’s appli­cations range from finding more accurate pat­terns in
weather to becoming the cutting-edge tool in financial analysis that’s worth
millions of dollars (BBC). Its ability would usher a new age of computing that
scientists in the past would have deemed impossible.

Despite all the promise that it offers, quan­tum computing remains a
relatively infantile field. The D-Wave system is not perfect and their
processing capabilities are currently limited. In addition, quantum computers
like D-Wave’s cost between $10 million to $15 million due to the difficulty
behind building one (BBC). These machines require liquid nitrogen to cool its
hardware to just above absolute zero (-273.15 C) in order to maintain its
quantum state and any interference, whether outside or inside, could
po­tentially destroy the fragile balance in the system. Yet despite the
difficulties involved, the field of quantum computing has attracted the
attention of international organizations around the world who are interested
in a slice of this revolution­ary new benchmark in scientific achievement. In
the end, we should expect further details about the semiconductor industry’s
latest and greatest solution as it seems like Moore’s law won’t be broken
anytime soon.
