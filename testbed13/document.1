# Quantum Computing

## How D-Wave Systems Work

A quantum computer taps directly into the fundamental fabric of reality – the
strange and counterintuitive world of quantum mechanics – to speed
computation.

##

## Quantum Computation

Rather than store information as 0s or 1s as conventional computers do, a
quantum computer uses qubits – which can be a 1 or a 0 or both at the same
time. This “quantum superposition”, along with the quantum effects of
entanglement and quantum tunnelling, enable quantum computers to consider and
manipulate all combinations of bits simultaneously, making quantum computation
powerful and fast.

## How D-Wave Systems Work

Quantum computing uses an entirely different approach than classical
computing. A useful analogy is to think of a landscape with mountains and
valleys.

Solving optimization problems can be thought of as trying to find the lowest
point on this landscape. Every possible solution is mapped to coordinates on
the landscape, and the altitude of the landscape is the “energy’” or “cost” of
the solution at that point. The aim is to find the lowest point on the map and
read the coordinates, as this gives the lowest energy, or optimal solution to
the problem.

Classical computers running classical algorithms can only "walk over this
landscape". Quantum computers can tunnel through the landscape making it
faster to find the lowest point. The D-Wave processor considers all the
possibilities simultaneously to determine the lowest energy required to form
those relationships. The computer returns many very good answers in a short
amount of time - 10,000 answers in one second. This gives the user not only
the optimal solution or a single answer, but also other alternatives to choose
from.

D-Wave systems use "quantum annealing"  to solve problems.  Quantum annealing
“tunes” qubits from their superposition state to a classical state to return
the set of answers scored to show the best solution.

## Programming D-Wave

To program the system a user maps their problem into this search for the
lowest point. A user interfaces with the quantum computer by connecting to it
over a network, as you would with a traditional computer. The user’s problems
are sent to a server interface, which turns the optimization program into
machine code to be programmed onto the chip. The system then executes a
"quantum machine instruction" and the results are returned to the user.

D-Wave systems are designed to be used in conjunction with classical
computers, as a "quantum co-processor".

## Capabilities

D-Wave’s flagship product, the 1000-qubit D-Wave 2X quantum computer, is the
most advanced quantum computer in the world. It is based on a novel type of
superconducting processor that uses quantum mechanics to massively accelerate
computation. It is best suited to tackling complex optimization problems that
exist across many domains such as:

  * Optimization
  * Machine Learning
  * Pattern Recognition and Anomaly Detection
  * Financial Analysis
  * Software/Hardware Verification and Validation
