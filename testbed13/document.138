# Confirmed, finally: D-Wave quantum computer is sometimes sluggish

The D-Wave Two quantum computer clocks in no faster than a standard PC, but
those already well-known results still leave us scratching our heads over
speed testing.

D-Wave Systems, the leading manufacturer of the world's first commercially
available quantum computers, is the most well funded and far along player in
the quantum chip race, but hasn't yet succeeded in convincing scientists that
its machines are successfully achieving quantum speedup. In other words, we're
not sure that its product is speedier than traditional, silicon-based
machines.

In fact, in certain situations, the $15 million D-Wave Two is still no faster
than the computer on your desk right now.

A research team at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich reports
that there is still a lack of definitive evidence that the D-Wave Two can
perform functions any faster than traditional machines. The results of the
test were published in the journal Science Thursday, though the work of head
physicist Matthias Troyer has been widely circulated since January because the
paper was available in pre-print.

"Using random spin glass instances as a benchmark, we find no evidence of
quantum speedup when the entire data set is considered, and obtain
inconclusive results when comparing subsets of instances on an instance-by-
instance basis," Troyer, a physicist at the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology, wrote.

Quantum speedup is the process by which a computer not based on silicon --
D-Wave uses tiny liquid helium-cooled loops of niobium for its computers --
can bypass traditional computational limits through the quirky, occasionally
unexplainable weirdness of quantum mechanics. While binary computers are
restricted to math-based computations using bits that flip between 1 and 0,
quantum computers hijack properties like entanglement and superposition using
quantum bits, or qubits, that exist as 1 and 0 simultaneously, theoretically
amping up the calculation speed exponentially.

The Zurich tech is yet another conflicting assessment of D-Wave's hardware --
and runs counter to the results touted by D-Wave itself, as well as Google.
The search giant last year established its Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab
in a partnership with the NASA Ames Research Center and Universities Space
Research Association. The goal is to use quantum computations to unearth new
ways of breaking through the computation walls currently plaguing the progress
of algorithmic AI and machine learning. Google is using D-Wave as its primary
product.

Google and NASA celebrated the D-Wave Two back in January with test results of
its own showcasing the D-Wave's quantum speedup clocking in at 35,500 times
faster than off-the-shelf optimization solvers. But Google was quick to point
out, as Troyer laid out in the Science article, that there is no clear cut way
of testing quantum computation because we don't really know how to calculate,
or even detect, quantum speedup, let alone set a standard for benchmarking.

"While this is an interesting baseline, these competitors are general-purpose
solvers. You can create much tougher classical competition by writing highly
optimized code that accounts for the sparse connectivity structure of the
current D-Wave chip," Google admitted in a blog post concerning the results.

Google even cites Troyer and his team's results as reason not to hail the
D-Wave as a catch-all quantum computer: "Two world-class teams have done that
[wrote highly optimized code]. One is a team at ETH Zurich led by Matthias
Troyer, considered to be one of the world's strongest computational
physicists. With help from Nvidia, his team managed to write classical
simulated annealing code running on GPUs that achieves an incredible 200 spin
updates per nanosecond. The other tailor-made classical competitor was written
by Alex Selby. You may recall he won £1 million for cracking the Eternity
puzzle."

D-Wave was not pleased with the way the Troyer test has been perceived for
those very reasons, as co-founder Geordie Rose told Wired's Clive Thompson in
May. "[They] had the best algorithm ever developed by a team of the top
scientists in the world, finely tuned to compete on what this processor does,
running on the fastest processors that humans have ever been able to build,"
he said. And D-Wave's offering "is now competitive with those things, which is
a remarkable step," he added.

Troyer and his team were using the University of Southern California's D-Wave
Two and running it against a Cray supercomputer software optimizer tuned
specifically to run blazingly fast on an Intel desktop.

"Basically, the paper being released in Science looks at a narrow set of
benchmarking problems that aren't expected to show an advantage for quantum
annealing," a D-Wave spokesperson told CNET, adding that Troyer's research
roused a similar debate back in January.

That brings up a central problem in the nascent quantum computing field right
now. A lot of the hype and debunking surrounding D-Wave is about shifting the
parameters around which tests are performed and against which kinds of
traditional machines optimized for various types of computations. So you can
make the D-Wave look 35,000 times faster -- or 100 times slower, as Troyer did
-- if you simply have it tackle certain types of problems and race it against
something that's really good, or crummy, at solving said problems.

One thing is clear: The D-Wave is no ordinary computer, and even Troyer and
the Zurich team will admit it can sometimes achieve speeds up to five times
faster than the Intel PC. "Our results do not rule out the possibility of
speedup for other classes of problems and illustrate the subtle nature of the
quantum speedup question," Troyer concluded.

For now, quantum computing is still a bit of a question mark. Hitting that
quantum speedup remains an issue of feeding it the right problems and tuning
the D-Wave software to crack them. For now, there's no reason to write the
D-Wave off when quantum computing has barely arrived and there's still mounds
of work to do when it comes to figuring out how to adequately test it.
