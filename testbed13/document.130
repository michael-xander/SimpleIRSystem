# D-Wave quantum computer matches the tenth ranked supercomputer for speed

There have been years of controversy about whether the superconducting quantum
annealing computers manufactured by D-Wave are a) quantum computers; and b)
fast enough for a) to matter. Now a test of the 512-qubit Vesuvius chip
establishes at least that computing based on quantum annealing is, in the
words of a computer science professor at Amherst College, "in some cases,
really, really fast."

## Comparing apples and fish

Professor Catherine McGeoch is an expert on the sometimes obscure difficulties
that crop up when evaluating and comparing different types of computing
performance. To prepare a study that would compare the performance of a
classical computer against that of a quantum computer, McGeoch had to learn
the principles, quirks, and foibles of adiabatic quantum computing, of which
quantum annealing is a special form.

"It’s such a whole different approach to computation that you have to wrap
your head around this new way of doing things in order to decide how to
evaluate it." said Prof. McGeoch. "It’s like comparing apples and oranges, or
apples and fish, and the difficulty was coming up with experiments and
analyses that allowed you to say you’d compared things properly. It definitely
was the oddest set of problems I've ever coped with.”

McGeoch was testing a D-Wave Vesuvius chip about the size of a thumbnail
possessing 512 qubits (439 of which were operational – not too bad for the
fifth chip of this type.) The D-Wave chip operates at only 20 milliKelvin
above absolute zero – the low operating temperature is required to avoid
having thermal fluctuations swamp quantum processing (and could limit its mass
market appeal).

The basic structure of the chip is designed to model Ising spin models. This
is a particularly simple choice operationally, and offers the advantage that a
huge number of interesting problems can be mapped onto an Ising spin model.

The classical computer used for most tests was powered by a cluster of seven
Intel Xeon E5-2609 processors running at 2.4 GHz. Comparing to Linpack
benchmark results from massively parallel computers using similar processors,
the D-Wave Vesuvius chip obtained a (very approximate) Linpack rating of 420
GFlops.

## Put to the test

Three fundamentally hard computational problems were chosen to test the speed
of the D-Wave computer, which all have similarities to the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP).

The Travelling Salesman Problem for a 15 city trip around Germany

The TSP involves a salesman who has a number of cities where he must sell his
goods. Being an efficient sort, he wants to plan his sales trip so that he
only goes to each city once, and also wants to drive as few miles as possible.
Planning the sales trip is the TSP. It is an NP-complete (nondeterministic
polynomial time) problem, meaning that there is no simple way of generating an
optimum solution. On classical computers, rather simple sets of cities can
require billions or trillions of hours of computation to find the true minimum
solution. However, the TSP is a natural to be solved by quantum annealing.

How did the D-Wave computer do on the tests? On the largest problem sizes
tested, the V5 chip found optimal solutions in less than half a second, while
the best classical software solver required 30 minutes to find those same
solutions. This makes the D-Wave computer over 3,600 times faster than the
classical computer in these tests.

This puts the effective speed of the D-Wave quantum computer on this class of
problems at roughly the same as the tenth ranked supercomputer in the world as
per the November 2012 Top500 list – the IBM/DARPS Trial Subset, with 63,360
64-bit cores that produce a maximum floating point performance of 1.5
petaFlops. The comparison shouldn't be taken too seriously, but suggests that
the 439 qubits of the D-Wave computer can solve such problems as quickly as do
huge massively parallel supercomputers.

Prof. McGeoch has also done some preliminary tests on the sixth Vesuvius chip
(having 503 good qubits), and is finding performance figures of about 5
petaFlops, which is about three times the computational speed of the 439 good
qubits chip. This would push the D-Wave up to fifth position.

The question remains, just how useful is D-Wave's chip? Its current approach
to quantum computing is focused tightly on problems that map nicely onto an
Ising model. However, it is known that adiabatic quantum computing can
efficiently reproduce any computation of which a more conventional quantum
gate computer is capable. Such reproduction is not trivial, but offers some
hope that the D-Wave approach may in time address wider applications.

The video below provides a close look at the structure of the D-Wave chips and
how the number of qubits on a chip is outpacing Moore's Law.
