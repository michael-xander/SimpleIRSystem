# Quantum or not, controversial computer runs no faster than a normal one

By Adrian ChoJun. 19, 2014 , 2:15 PM

The D-Wave computer, marketed as a groundbreaking quantum machine that runs
circles around conventional computers, solves problems no faster than an
ordinary rival, a new test shows. Some researchers call the test of the
controversial device, described online today in _Science_, the fairest
comparison yet. But D-Wave argues that the computations used in the study were
too easy to show what its novel chips can do.

"This is likely the most thorough and precise study that has been done on the
performance of the D-Wave machine," says Helmut Katzgraber, a computational
physicist at Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, who was not involved
in the work. However, Colin Williams, a quantum-computer scientist and
D-Wave’s director of business development, says the problems used as
benchmarks were "not at all the right choice for probing a quantum speedup."

D-Wave Systems, a startup in Burnaby, Canada, has sold machines to Lockheed
Martin Corp. and Google. The company claimed an earlier version of its $10
million machine was 35,500 times faster than an ordinary computer. However, to
test D-Wave’s machine, Matthias Troyer, a physicist at the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology, Zurich, and colleagues didn't just race it against an
ordinary computer. Instead, they measured how the time needed to solve a
problem increases with the problem's size. That's key because the whole idea
behind quantum computing is that the time will grow much more slowly for a
quantum computer than for an ordinary one. In particular, a full-fledged
"universal" quantum computer should be able to factor huge numbers ever faster
than an ordinary computer as the size of the numbers grow.

The D-Wave machine is not a universal quantum computer, however, but a more
limited "quantum annealer." Its processor consists of a 2D array of quantum
bits, or qubits, made of superconducting loops that carry electric currents.
The qubits act like tiny magnets that can point up, down, or—thanks to quantum
weirdness—both up and down at the same time. Each qubit can interact with
certain others through linkers that can be programmed so that the qubits can
lower their energy by pointing either in the same direction or in opposite
directions. The idea is to encode a problem by specifying the hundreds of
interactions within the chip and solve it by finding the qubits' lowest energy
"ground state."

To do that, the machine starts with each qubit in an up-and-down state and
slowly turns on the interactions. The system then seeks the lowest energy
state, like a marble rolling across an evolving energy landscape to find the
deepest valley. In a nonquantum device, the jiggling of thermal energy would
drive the marble over the terrain to the low spot through a process called
thermal annealing. In the D-Wave machine, however, the marble supposedly also
"tunnels" quantum mechanically between the low spots to find the lowest one
faster. For problems such as pattern recognition or machine learning, that
might give the quantum machine an edge.

But is the D-Wave chip really quicker than a conventional computer? To find
out, Troyer and Daniel Lidar, a physicist at the University of Southern
California in Los Angeles, tested the Lockheed Martin machine against a
conventional computer programmed to simulate thermal annealing. To keep things
simple for the D-Wave chip, they didn’t ask it to do practical calculations.
Instead, they merely set the interactions between qubits randomly and timed
how long it took the machine to find its ground state.

In spite of that home-field advantage, the D-Wave chip produced no quantum
speedup. The researchers ran problems for different-sized groups of qubits,
ranging from the chip's basic unit of eight to its total of 512. The computing
time for the conventional computer increased exponentially with the number of
qubits. But so did the time for the D-Wave machine, Troyer says.

Ironically, the test may not be revealing because the problems may have been
easy for the ordinary computer, too, says Texas A&amp;M's Katzgraber. Choosing
interactions at random, he explains, typically creates test problems in which
qubits lock into a low-energy configuration only exactly at zero temperature.
That means that at any higher temperature, the energy landscape rolls gently
and thermal annealing can readily coax the system to the solution. Given the
easiness of the problems for both machines, Katzgraber says, the study is like
"two world-class skiers racing on the bunny slope."

But some researchers doubt that a quantum annealer will ever produce a useful
quantum speedup. Theory strongly suggests that, unlike a universal quantum
computer, it can't, says Umesh Vazirani, a computer scientist at the
University of California, Berkeley. "I would bet that there's not a speedup,"
he says. Hartmut Neven, director of engineering at Google, counters that he is
"convinced that we will be able to find problem classes for which a next-
generation quantum annealer will outperform any classical algorithm."
