# ​University of Sydney receives quantum computing grant from US intelligence

The University of Sydney has been awarded a share in a multimillion dollar
grant from a United States government agency to pursue quantum computing
research.

The University of Sydney has been awarded a slice of a multimillion dollar
research grant from the United States Office of the Director of National
Intelligence to advance its research in quantum computing.

The undisclosed funding chunk will be injected into the Quantum Control
Laboratory, which is led out of the university's month-old AU$150 million
Sydney Nanoscience Hub.

Additionally, an international consortium which includes the University of
Sydney has also been selected by the US government-led LogiQ program to help
deliver a logical quantum-bit (qubit) based on trapped ions.

The LogiQ program is an initiative run by US government agency the
Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, which is seeking creative
technical solutions to the challenge of encoding imperfect physical qubits
into a logical qubit, with a quibit forming the foundations for quantum
computing.

According to Sydney University's associate professor Michael Biercuk, a
logical qubit is considered a holy grail in quantum information.

"Ions represent a fantastic platform helping us to learn how we can exploit
the most exotic phenomena in quantum physics as resources powering a new
generation of technologies," Biercuk said.

"There remain enormous challenges bringing any quantum computing technology to
reality, but trapped ions have demonstrated the critical building blocks
essential for this effort, decades ahead of other proposed technologies."

According to the university, quantum computing promises dramatic advantages
over conventional computation; however, it said progress has been stymied by
the fragility of systems obeying the rules of quantum physics. The LogiQ
program aims to overcome these challenges by effectively stabilising the
quantum hardware, the university said.

The University of New South Wales (UNSW) officially opened its new Centre for
Quantum Computation and Communications Technology (CQC2T) last month, where a
team of researchers are racing to build the world's first quantum computer in
silicon.

Well on their way to achieving their goal, a team of UNSW's engineers already
unlocked the key to enabling quantum computer coding in silicon, announcing in
November that the team had the capability to write and manipulate a quantum
version of computer code using two quantum bits in a silicon microchip.

According to UNSW, in achieving this breakthrough the team has removed
lingering doubts that such operations can be made reliably enough to allow
powerful quantum computers to become a reality.

The breakthrough followed on from an announcement made in October when another
team of engineers from the university built a quantum logic gate in silicon,
which made calculations between two qubits of information possible.

At the time, Andrew Dzurak, Scientia professor at the university, said it was
a landmark result not only for Australia but for the world, as until now it
had not been possible to make two quantum bits "talk" to each other and create
a logic gate using silicon.

Following UNSW's advancements, the federal government allocated AU$26 million
of its AU$500 million science funding to support the university's work in
quantum computing.

The science funding forms part of Australia's AU$1.1 billion National
Innovation and Science Agenda that was unveiled in December.

Within 48 hours of the cash injection from Turnbull, the Commonwealth Bank of
Australia pledged AU$10 million over five years to support the university's
researchers. Telstra then matched CommBank's efforts, also pledging AU$10
million over five years to boost UNSW's capacity to develop the world's first
silicon-based quantum computer.
