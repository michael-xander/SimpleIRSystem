# CodingQuBit (2001)

### QuBit is a library to support Quantum Superpositions in C++. This allows
each _CQuBit_ variable to hold a number of different values _at the same
time_. Normal mathematical operations can be performed on a QuBit, but they
affect every value in the QuBit, _at the same time_. Binary Operations on two
QuBits cause a result based on _every_ possible outcome.

  

##  Watch the lecture at FOSDEM 2010

  

##  Example of QuBit

a = { 1, 2, 3 };| b = a + 10;| b = { 11, 12, 13 };  
---|---|---  
a = { 2, 4, 6 }; b = { 10 ,100 ,1000 };| c = a * b;| c = { 20, 40, 60, 200,
400, 600, 2000, 4000, 6000 };  
_This is pseudo-code for demonstrative purposes only! The C++ comes later!_

Each value can only exist in a QuBit once. There is no 'weighting' applied if
a value is added several times.

Comparisons with a QuBit also occur with all the values _at the same time_.
This means a search is simply,

` qb = (1,2,3,4,5);  
if qb eq 5 print "There's a '5' in the QuBit, somewhere!"  
`

  

##  Quantum Stuff

The above examples demonstrate the basic functionality of QuBit. It's not
significantly more complex than 'sets'. However, there are a few functions
that take the extra step into 'gaga' land!

A QuBit can be in three possible states:

  * Disjunctive
  * Conjunctive
  * Collapsed

  

###  Disjunctive

All states are considered when performing arithmetic (at the same time,
remember!), but this not necessarily true of comparisons. A disjunctive QuBit
will consider that if _any_ of the individual comparisons evaluate to 'true',
the whole expression will evaluate to 'true'. In psuedo-code:

if any{10,15,20,25} < 20 then print "At least one of these numbers is lower
than 20"  
  

###  Conjunctive

Here, a comparison will evaluate to 'true' if _all_ it's individual values
evaluate to 'true'. In psuedo-code:

if all{10,15,20,25} < 20 then print "All of these numbers are lower than 20"  
  

###  Collapsed

This occurs ofter a comparison has been made. The QuBit has exhausted all it's
superpositions to produce the result, and is consequently empty. It does,
however, contain a 'true' or 'false' value, dependent on the result. (You'll
see how this boolean result is obtained later)

  

###  Eigenstates

A collapsed quantum state is useful - but not that useful! It might be useful
to know that there is (at least) one number less than 20 in a particular case,
but it would be _more_ useful to know _which_ numbers are less than 20. To
find this information, we use the eigenstates of the QuBit. Pseudo-code,
anyone?

v = any{10,15,20,25} < 20  
if v then print "Those numbers less than 20 are " eigenstates(v)  
  

##  Declaring and Using a QuBit

We now turn to the actual C++ code require to perform these Quantum miracles!
QuBit is, itself, a template and is therefore created with:

`CQuBit<float> q;`  

This declares a Quantum superposition called 'q', consisting of floating point
numbers. To add or remove values to this variable, you may use the following
functions:

`  q.Add(10); // Add '10'  
 q.Add(2); // Add '2'  
 q.AddRange(100,200); // Add every number from '100' to '200', inclusive  
 q.AddRange(10,11,0.1f); // Add every number from '10' to '11' in steps of
'0.1'  
 q.Remove(10.5f); // Remove the number '10.5'  
  
` You can also construct a QuBit, using the ranged constructor,  
`CQuBit<float> q(100,200); // exactly the same as example three above`  

Use of QuBit is the same as any other variable. Since all (see note below)
operators are overloaded you can write natural looking code, such as 'a+b', or
'a/=2'. You can use binary operations (such as additional or multiplication)
with either one CQuBit and one float, or two CQuBits, as you see fit. Note
restrictions.

  

##  Quantum-Orientated Member Functions

Having created a quantum superposition (with either `Add` or `AddRange`), it
is now time to use it. Looking at the examples above, we can find if any value
is less than 20 with this code.

` CQuBit<float> q(10,25,5);  
CQuBit<float> ans;  
  
 ans = q.Any() < 20;  
 if (ans.GetBoolResult()) cout << "At least one of these numbers is lower than
20";  
`

The QuBit can also be treated as a disjunctive with the code `q.Any();`,
allowing you to re-write the above thus:

` CQuBit<float> q(10,25,5);  
CQuBit<float> ans;  
  
 q.Any();  
 ans = q < 20;  
 if (ans.GetBoolResult()) cout << "At least one of these numbers is lower than
20";  
`

Although the results of the comparison (i.e. q < 20) is boolean, the C++
version of the library forces the result type to be a CQuBit. You then
determine whether it collapsed to 'true' or 'false' with the 'GetBoolResult()'
member function. This is to allow retrieval of the eigenstates (if only a bool
were returned this information would get lost). Using eigenstatees to find
those values less than 20, one can use:

` CQuBit<float> q(10,25,5);  
CQuBit<float> ans;  
  
 q.Any();  
 ans = q < 20;  
 if (ans.GetBoolResult()) cout << "These numbers are lower than 20: " <<
ans.Eigenstates();  
`

The `Eigenstates` function returns a QuBit itself, so could be applied to
further calculations.

_Note:_Eigenstates could have been implemented in a similar fashion to PERL,
with a cache storing the result of the last comparison operation. However, as
it didn't feel very 'C' to be using global variables in this manner, so I
adopted a QuBit return type, and 'GetBoolResult' to retrieve the comparisons'
result. (Technically speaking this might also be considered storing a global!)

`All` is used in exactly the same manner as above. Only the results differ
(obviously!).

` CQuBit<float> q(10,25,5);  
CQuBit<float> ans;  
  
 q.All();  
 ans = q < 20;  
 if (ans.GetBoolResult()) cout << "All of these numbers are lower than 20: ";  
`  
_Streams_

The output stream produces space delimitted list of the states, enclosed in
braces.

` CQuBit<float> q;  
 q.AddRange(15,20);  
 cout << q;  
` _produces_ { 15 16 17 18 19 20 }  

The input stream, will read this format into the QuBit, and leave the stream
pointer immediately after the closing brace.

  
  

##  Set-Orientated Member Functions

The `Any` and `All` methods have another function: set manipulation. Recall
that QuBits is basically an implementation of set handling. Also recall, that
`Any` is disjunctive. So, if _any_ of {1,2,3} is combined with _any_ of
{4,5,6}, the result is a union; {1,2,3,4,5,6}. Written in code, this would be:

` CQuBit<float> q1(1,3);  
CQuBit<float> q2(4,6);  
CQuBit<float> ans;  
  
 ans.Any(q1, q2); // The result is {1,2,3,4,5,6}  
`

_Note:_ QuBit ignores the type of original quantum states. So in this case,
`q1` and `q2` could be conjunctive or disjunctive, the answer would be
identical in both cases. All collapsed QuBits are ignored

Well, `Any` is union, it should be obvious what `All` (the conjunctive state)
should be! One brownie point to everyone who said 'intersection'. The
resultant QuBit features only those values present in _both_ of the original
superpositions.

` CQuBit<float> q1(1,6);  
CQuBit<float> q2(4,5);  
CQuBit<float> ans;  
  
 ans.All(q1, q2); // The result is {4,5}  
`

  

##  Sample Code

Here are a number of small examples (all available for download in the zip
file below). I have given the PERL code also, to show linage, as well as to
provide a parallel for those familar with the language, or the
Quantum::Superpositions library available.

Function| PERL| C++ (using QuBit)  
---|---|---  
min| `eigenstates(any() <= all())`| `(ql.Any() <= ql.All()).Eigenstates()`  
max| `eigenstates(any() >= all())`| `(ql.Any() >= ql.All()).Eigenstates()`  
IsPrime| `==2 || % all(2..sqrt()+1) != 0`|  ` if (i==2) return true;  
prime.AddRange(2, sqrt(i)+1);  
ans = (i % prime.All()) != 0;  
return ans.GetBoolResult();`  
  
factor| ` = / any(2..-1);  
eigenstates(floor()==);`| `CQuBit<float> n, q;`  
  
` n.AddRange(2, i-1);  
q = i/n.Any();  
q = q.Floor()==q;  
return q.Eigenstates();`  
  
  
  

##  Limitations

QuBits are only concerned with values. Therefore, the return value from post
and pre decrement operators are identical. i.e. _a++_ and _++a_, are the same
as _a++_. This **doesn't** mean that _a++_ and _++a_ are different, just that
the return type from _a++_ is a value (as it should be), but _++a_ is **not**
a reference to the _a_ variable, as you might expect.

a = {1,2,3}| b = a++;| a = {2,3,4}; b = {1,2,3};  
---|---|---  
a = {1,2,3}| b = ++a;| a = {2,3,4}; b = {2,3,4};  
  
Some compilers (noticable Microsoft's!) refuse to compile this code as is. To
help those poor unfortunates, I've removed a couple of the friend functions
with an _#if 0_. Namely,

  * friend CQuBit<_T> operator+(const _T &amp;a;, const CQuBit<_T> &amp;b;)
  * friend CQuBit<_T> operator*(const _T &amp;a;, const CQuBit<_T> &amp;b;)
  * friend CQuBit<_T> operator-(const _T &amp;a;, const CQuBit<_T> &amp;b;)

These prevent compilation of code such as, _q2 = 5 * q1_. This means you'll
have to re-write your code by swapping the arguments over, or by creating a
QuBit containing one entry. The code works, however.

The set of operators catered for are:

!| ~| -| %| %=| &| &=| &&|  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
*| *=| +| +=| -| -=| /| /=| &lt;&lt;  
&lt;&lt;=| &gt;&gt;| &gt;&gt;=| =| ^| ^=| || |=| ||  
++ (pre and post)| \-- (pre and post)| &lt;| &lt;=| &gt;| &gt;=| ==| !=|  
Notes: &gt;&gt; &amp; &lt;&lt; are also handled for streams.  
The array operator ([]) is overloaded to retrieve individual state values,
i.e. if a={10,20,30}, then a[0]=10, a[1]=20 and a[2]=30.
