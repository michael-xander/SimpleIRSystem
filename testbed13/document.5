# Google Claims Its D-Wave Quantum Computer Is the Real Deal—Sort Of

On Tuesday night, a team of computer scientists and physicists from Google
posted a study to the arXiv open-access server containing a very bold claim:
The quantum computer Google had purchased from Canadian start-up D-Wave
systems in 2013 is in fact performing quantum computations as advertised.

Why shouldn't it be? Fair question. The D-Wave computer has been a source of
controversy for years now, with many if not most quantum computing experts
disputing D-Wave's claims of having achieved true quantum computing. Making
things even more difficult is that the D-Wave computer is only meant to enact
one particular subset of quantum computing, known as quantum annealing, which
makes it quite unlike the more fundamental machines—fundamental in that they
can be expected to perform any computation a classical computer can be
expected to compute—being worked on in laboratories around the globe.

In other words, it's not a universal computer or really anything close to it.
It solves one sort of problem.

The Google paper hasn't been peer reviewed or otherwise accepted for
publication in a proper journal, but Google obviously isn't your run-of-the-
mill open-access crank either. The new results are based on head to head
comparisons between the D-Wave machine and a classical single-core computer
simulating the annealing functions of its quantum peer. The researchers found
a speed-up by a factor of 108 with the D-Wave computer, which is a whole lot
of zeroes.

Quantum annealing is a way of finding optimal solutions for problems with a
bunch of variables. The basic idea is that you start out with every possible
solution together in a single superimposed state and then watch as it
collapses into lower and lower energy states, each one being a new local
minima. Because quantum physics is really weird, it's possible for particles
to tunnel out of their current local minima and possibly find one of an even
lower energy thanks to natural random fluctuations.

So, like this, a system can find a state that minimizes the values of its
variables. This is hardly trivial—algorithms that try to find optimizations
aren't cheap, and artificial intelligence and machine learning schemes are
mostly based on really big optimizations involving lots of variables. The
benchmarking performed in the new paper is based on roughly 1,000 binary
variables.

Neat. But there is one big problem: The D-Wave machine was tested against only
a classical computer simulating the same quantum algorithm. Pitting it against
_any_ classical optimization algorithm, and things start to look a whole lot
different, as the Google researchers note: "Based on the results presented
here, one cannot claim a quantum speedup for D-Wave 2X, as this would require
that the quantum processor in question outperforms the best known classical
algorithm."

Quantum annealing might then remain as a cool idea more so than a truly
practical one, and, as far as general quantum computing, physicists and
engineers are still wrangling with the bare fundamentals. This fall's big news
was the first successful implementation of a two-qubit quantum logic gate on a
silicon substrate, which isn't all that far from the drawing board.
