# Canada’s spies closely watching quantum tech developments

CSE sees both “advantages and disadvantages” in quantum computing’s ability to
crack modern encryption techniques.

OTTAWA--Canada's electronic spies are working on ways to defend government
systems from the "impending threat" of quantum computing, a document obtained
by the Star shows.

The Communications Security Establishment warned chief Greta Bossenmaier that
emerging quantum technology could "easily break" today's strongest methods of
protecting electronic information.

"A new class of technologies that operates at quantum speeds is beginning to
move from the domain of academic curiosity into the world of commercial
technological reality," the memo, heavily censored and stamped secret, reads.

"Quantum computing poses an impending threat to widely-deployed public-key
cryptography (PKC) and therefore has a significant impact on any information
being protected with PKC."

Governments, journalists, activists and hackers have increasingly turned to
public-key encryption to protect information. Journalists protect sources,
activists and hackers protect themselves and the people they communicate with,
and governments protect classified or sensitive information from theft or
eavesdropping.

When implemented correctly, it is very difficult for malicious actors -- even
with serious resources and expertise -- to crack the code.

But quantum technology greatly increases the power and speed of computer
functions, allowing computers to break today's strongest encryption methods.

On the other, CSE notes that quantum technology can be used to create
"unbreakable" encryption for communications -- but that technology is
"extremely challenging" to deploy and manage, especially on a large scale.

As a result, CSE has focused their efforts on developing a "quantum resistant
algorithm" for "Medium (Security) Assurance/Commercial" information. The memo
stated the algorithm aims to strengthen traditional encryption, but the agency
says their efforts "are still unfolding."

While the uncensored portion of the memo deals with defence against quantum
attacks, the document does not make clear if CSE is exploring using quantum to
break encryption, themselves. And while it has become a pressing topic in the
United States, with the FBI trying to force Apple to "unlock" their customers'
phones, there has been relatively little debate about encryption in Canada.

The Star requested an interview with CSE to discuss the memo Monday afternoon.
In a written statement Tuesday evening, CSE media relations said the agency is
looking at quantum primarily from a defensive perspective.

"We are focused on defensive use of quantum technology," wrote CSE
spokesperson Ryan Foreman. "Specifically, we are focusing our efforts in
response to the threat of quantum to protecting and encrypting sensitive
Government of Canada information."

Foreman added that CSE believes quantum will eventually be able to improve the
agency's protection of sensitive information.

CSE is also clearly interested in partnering with academic institutions
developing new quantum technology. According to the memo, CSE has a
partnership with the University of Waterloo's Institute for Quantum Computing
(IQC).

IQC is a world-leading research outfit on quantum computing, and is affiliated
with Waterloo's Perimeter Institute of Theoretical Physics. The Perimeter
Institute, founded by BlackBerry co-founder Mike Lazaridis, just received a
$50 million, five-year grant from the federal government.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that funding on Friday, giving
reporters a brief primer on quantum computing that drew a fair amount of
attention. In their first public post on Twitter Tuesday, the CSE joked that
they were "into quantum computing before the Prime Minister made it cool." The
document reviewed by the Star supports that assertion.

IQC executive director Raymond Laflamme said that CSE is "very interested" in
the work the institute does. But he noted that the widespread use of quantum
computing is still many years away.

IQC and MIT currently hold the world record for the most "qubits" -- quantum
bits -- used in an experiment, with 12. Teams across the world are attempting
to assemble a quantum computer with 100 qubits within five years. To break
today's encryption, Laflamme said, you would need to work with thousands of
qubits.

"We're at 10, so you're still pretty safe," Laflamme said with a laugh.

Still, Laflamme said that since all information transmitted on the Internet is
stored somewhere, it might be possible to go back and access encrypted files
once quantum computing is a reality. That has national security agencies,
including the NSA in the United States, trying to grapple with quantum
encryption sooner rather than later.
