## What the Canadian prime minister messed up in the video clip that everyone
loved.

By Konstantin Kakaes April 18 Follow kkakaes

fellow at New America, where he writes about the evolving uses of drones.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau showed off his geek side by answering a
reporter's question about quantum computing. The crowd laughed and cheered
while he confidently explained how computers work, though his answer wasn't
quite right. (AP/CTV)



Over the weekend, a video of the boyishly handsome Canadian prime minister,
Justin Trudeau, briefly discussing quantum computing at a news conference made
the rounds. “A bit of genius,” rhapsodized New York magazine, while Gizmodo’s
headline said, “Everyone Should Be Able to Explain Quantum Computing Like
Justin Trudeau.” Choose a popular science or tech publication (or The
Washington Post) and you’ll find a version of the same breathless headline.
Even the Guardian’s science blog, while arguing that “we should raise our
expectations,” called his explanation “quite a good one.”

Except that Trudeau’s explanation of quantum computing was actually not quite
right. (Never mind that the question was the punchline to a joke that Trudeau
had set up earlier.) “Normal computers work, either there’s power going
through a wire or not,” he said. This much is correct, as was Trudeau’s
explanation of classical bits: “Regular computer bit is either a one or a
zero, on or off.” But Trudeau’s succinct attempt at glossing quantum bits was
wrong: “What quantum states allow for is much more complex information to be
encoded into a single bit.”

This isn’t the place for a full primer on quantum computing, though Seth
Lloyd’s “Programming the Universe” is a good non-technical introduction. A
single qubit, or quantum bit, is neither a 0 nor a 1 until it is measured.
This doesn’t mean it has “more complex information” encoded into it, though.
Once you measure it — which you have to do if you are to do any computing —
you can get only a 0 or a 1. There’s no additional complexity there. As this
quantum computing textbook explains, you can gain only one bit of information
about whatever question you were originally asking by measuring one qubit.

Why, then, are quantum computers powerful?

A quantum computer measures a qubit (or qubits) at the end of a computation or
series of computations. Because intermediate steps have been taken while each
qubit is neither a 0 nor a 1 but in a mixed state that has some probability of
being one or the other, a quantum computer can do _some types of computations
_much faster than a normal computer could. The power of quantum computers
grows when you entangle many qubits together. The capability of quantum
computers, in a sense, grows exponentially — very, very fast — with the number
of qubits you can successfully entangle together. Keeping qubits entangled
together until you want to measure the output — or “coherent,” in the parlance
— has been very difficult, which is why progress in quantum computing has been
slow.

At present, a quantum computer isn’t typically smaller than a conventional
one, as Trudeau said. Quantum computers have only recently been able to
perform computations such as figuring out that 15=3×5. (Some earlier quantum
computers were able to make this calculation, but only by what one expert
calls “cheating,” in a technical rather than moral sense.) The laser trap
needed to figure this sort of thing out isn’t huge — it fits on a table top —
but it is much bigger than microchips that can figure out the prime factors of
15 in the conventional manner.

_ [Canadians want to build a border wall, too] _

Exactly what “measurement” consists of is a thorny question that physicists
(and philosophers of physics) have still not fully resolved — it is at the
heart of the famous paradox about Schrödinger’s cat. One of the most exciting
things about quantum computing is that it turns the question of measurement
from one of primarily philosophical interest to one of vital engineering
importance — in so doing, quantum computing has the potential to not only
perform some computations (like factoring numbers) faster, but to help
scientists learn about the very nature of reality.

Does it matter that Trudeau was wrong? As Scott Aaronson, a noted quantum
computing expert, says, “The widespread praise for this reply surely says more
about how low the usual standards for politicians are, and about Trudeau’s
fine comic delivery, than about anything intrinsic to what he said.” The
experts polled by Motherboard can’t really be taken at face value, as who is
going to go out on a limb to criticize a photogenic politician who has just
brought your discipline into the limelight?

Trudeau’s mischaracterization matters only insofar as we care about _getting
it right_ for the sake of it. No physics student is going to be led astray by
his remarks, and people who don’t actually want to learn about quantum
computing are happy to be wooed by his starry eyes. The 50 million in Canadian
dollars that Trudeau announced was to be given to the Perimeter Institute for
Theoretical Physics is a very good thing. He created a new cabinet-level
science post and has renewed attention on the pressing issue of climate change
in Canada.

That’s all great news for scientists. It just doesn’t make him one.
