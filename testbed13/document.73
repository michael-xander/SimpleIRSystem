# Is the NSA trying to warn us that cryptography is dead?

  * By Graham Templeton on October 27, 2015 at 9:00 am
  * Comment

Back in August, the NSA released an updated advisory that was at once
interesting and expected: It said that the world had to prepare for the
oncoming impact of quantum computers, and the possibility that these devices
could render existing computer cryptography almost completely obsolete. They
called for the cryptographic community to invest heavily in developing so-
called post-quantum cryptographic solutions that could survive this
hypothetical watershed invention. And, as you might imagine, this advisory has
very nearly driven the internet insane. Now, two security researchers have
published a paper compiling all the various theories surrounding this
advisory, and trying to make sense of the situation.

Remember that quantum computers have obsessed internet weirdos for as long as
the concept has existed. Try really looking into the Deep Web sometime, and
you'll quickly come up against the idea of a quantum deep web, a deep deep
_deep_ web, that can only be accessed by/through Illuminati-style quantum
networks that, of course, don't actually exist. Much of this lore is simply
gleeful trolling by people who love to mislead noobs, but don't kid yourself
-- many of the most entrenched People Of The Internet really do believe this
crap.

So, unsurprisingly, now they believe _this_ crap. The biggest issue springs
for a single passage (emphasis mine):

> _For those partners and vendors that have not yet made the transition to
Suite B algorithms, **we recommend** **not making a significant expenditure**
to do so at this point but instead to prepare for the upcoming quantum
resistant algorithm transition._

The reason this has surprised so many people is that the NSA has been a long-
time supporter of several of what we might call pre-quantum cryptographic
solutions, new and highly advanced algorithms that shore up problems with
current solutions, but which would probably not be secure in the event of real
quantum computing. In particular, NSA has been a booster of Elliptical Curve
Cryptography (ECC), which makes this back-pedaling announcement a bit
confusing. They're now saying that this ECC is a stopgap solution waiting to
be made obsolete by quantum research -- but that's what it's _always_ been, so
what's changed?

DWave's (alleged) quantum computing chip.

However, while it's certainly _possible_ that NSA has a secret, super-
successful quantum computer behind closed doors, that looks very unlikely at
this point. Not only does NSA seem to lack the sheer volume of pure-science
research talent that would be necessary to compete with the major, openly
admitted research bodies, but the Edward Snowden leaks revealed absolutely no
indication that NSA has or soon expects to have access to post-quantum
capabilities.

And so, those viewing the situation have slid down to a possible explanation
that's at once more and less realistic: a conventional computer algorithm that
can break modern computer encryption through sheer mathematical efficiency.
This is more realistic, since it could theoretically come from the mind of
just a single brilliant analyst, and thus it could come from the NSA, out of
the blue and with no help from the private sector. On the other hand,
conventional wisdom in cryptography says that such a classical code-breaking
system is impossible, with a digital computer.

The fact is that "NSA Has Quantum!" is a bit like the tech-world's equivalent
of "Half Life 3 Confirmed" -- it's basically a joke at this point, but beneath
the sarcasm lies an understanding that the cliche does have to come true
_eventually_, even if not for a very, very long time. That's why both memes
have been so long-lived: Quantum computers seem like they _will_ come into
existence at some point, so no matter how many times they cry (or hint) wolf,
you've still got to be wary -- every single time.

When are they going to teach quantum computers to ENCRYPT stuff? Then maybe
we'll be right back to the start.

    * BummedOut

Exactly… And when will we have 100000000+ bit with rotating random key
generation??? LOL, I guess at that point everyone with have a Quantum
computer…

    * Felix Gill

there is no need for 'quantum computer encryption' because quantum
communication networks are uncrackable, and we are trying to create them
currently. Basically if you encode information in the quantum state of a
photon, then if it is ease dropped on it is immediately detectable as it
changes the stream. It is this aspect of quantum communications that destroys
the need for encryption. If you can deliver a message and if it is examined
before it gets to the send two things happen, 1, the sender automatically
knows an interception is happening, and two the message is in essence
destroyed. At least to the intended receiver.

" Emerging Technology From the arXiv  
May 17, 2010  
Commercial Quantum Cryptography System Hacked  
Physicists have mounted the first successful attack of its kind on a
commercial quantum cryptography system."

        * BummedOut

LOL…. If humans created it humans can hack it….

        * Felix Gill

In that hack -- they realized that if a brighter lightsource was introduced
into the system then it messed everything up. This is a true hack on a systems
level and a warning on how setting up the system is just as important as the
transmission line.

      * BenjaminShade

So you choose to give zero consideration to encryption of stored data? Just
because they can't intercept the transmission of data doesn't mean that
someone can't break in and steal your computer or physically swipe your phone.
Also quantum backbone lines will be very expensive, and furthermore have you
seen the haphazard rollout of fiber optic lines in the U.S.? Dollars to donuts
my money is on the idea that we won't see a purely quantum consumer network in
the next 50yrs or more.

        * Felix Gill

Data will be stored in the classical fashion. Qubits are useful for
calculation not storage.

Europe has been experimenting with how to setup a quantum network for the past
decade and are leaders in this research. Not that we are behind them… they
basically came to the conclusion they need to wait a decade or so for better
engineered parts.

          * BenjaminShade

As I understand it, the problem with a quantum network is that the encryption
is only point to point, as soon as you introduce a router or some other kind
of node it becomes the endpoint and the data must be re-encrypted and sent off
again. This would give whoever controlled the central hub the de-facto control
of the encryption.

        * Dave Chapman

In a world where donuts cost $1, the 1930s idiom "Dollars to donuts" is almost
as obsolete as DES-56. :-)

          * BenjaminShade

;-) That made me smile!

          * Geoff Shufflebotham

I paid $3.50 for a really good donut yesterday. No regrets

      * David Swanson

Just don't institute the Zeno effect by observing the communication thus
jamming it LOL!

      * Kevin Moore

When you're talking about security you're talking about a system not a sole
part of it. Talented hackers don't ask how do I get through the wall, they ask
how do I get around it. Even if you boil it down to solely a hack through
network resources someone will find a way through.

      * Irilis

Wouldn't that require point-to-point communication? No routers, no Internet…
Dedicated cables only. Expensive and with very limited application.

    * warcaster

Check out "quantum key distribution". China is already deploying it.

    * Grahaman27

because they you would need the power of a quantum computer to decrypt it as
well…

  * Raymond Rodgers

Not that I'm taking this seriously in any way, but what if the NSA's warning
isn't because they have a fully functional, "super successful" quantum
computer but instead have evidence that someone out there has been cracking
encrypted communications from multiple sources and algorithms within short
periods? Just a thought.

    * Kevin Moore

Since security experts originated the idea that encryption has become so
advanced that it's impossible for a digital computer to crack in any practical
amount of time (we're talking hundreds of thousands of years), our use and
size of networked super computers has fundamentally changed the way we think
about digital computing. Scientists are learning that through an extended
network of computer each computing micro portions of a problem that you can
process logic in ways previously thought impossible. For example the human
brain processes information differently than a digital computer but at a much
"slower" pace. This allows us to actually think and solve complex problems.
For many of those problems, digital computers have been able to make up for
their stupidity with exponentially increased speeds, however there are still
types of problems they can't solve with speed alone. Our modern cryptography
relies on those equations. However what we're currently experimenting with is
using a network of computers to function more similarly to a human brain. You
can think of each computer in a network functioning like an individual neuron
processing a small manageable portion of the problem and passing it on. It's
quite possible that this is the sort of thing that is invalidating our
cryptography. As soon as a computer is able to solve that equation logically
it's literally as easy to break as figuring out 1+1=2.

  * trasH

Well, I can't see why someone should have _already_ built a Quantum Computer
(QC) already.  
If the first _efficient_ QC is _indeed_ 10-50 years away, then obviously NSA
should already be worried. It's not (only) about your TLS FB connection, this
is NSA we're talking about: state secrets, military communication, you name
it. In these cases, a secret needs to _remain_ secret for much longer.

E.g. the Navajo code, remained a secret for 26 years (1942-1968), the Ultra
operation was only declassified 29 years later. I'm sure there are lot more
examples.

When Google, NSA and NASA are already funding D-Wave 2, while Intel is
investing on QC research, even if we're talking about such small amounts, QCs
are not just sci-fi scenarios; this is near future, at least for time periods
of tens of years. So, if NSA predicts that a 2-ton QC beast will reside at its
basement in 15 years, then indeed, today's (2015) secrets will not be safe at
all in 2030.

  * codeJunkie

This is a joke. I can write unbreakable encryption in seconds. Of course, it
is only secure as the key is, but none the less, without the key it is
unbreakable. The key is just random bytes, but the size of the key has to be
as big, or bigger, than the message you want to encrypt. Then it is just a
brutally simple Exclusive Or operation of the message and the key, poof
encrypted. XOR it again against the key and your message is back. What makes
it unbreakable is it is impossible to validate what the message actually says,
it could say literally anything with different keys.

    * koconor100

You want a very long key ?  
Take a picture of the morning traffic during a working day with your cell
phone camera.

    * BillBasham

Exactly right - well stated.

The real challenge is to get the key, which the NSA has had great success in
doing. "Give me the key or go to jail"

    * DukeAJuke ✓σοφός

What you say is correct. I think what they mean is the current mainstream
encryption technologies such as SSL, md4/5, sha, ripemd, whirlpool, tiger,
snefru, gost, adler32, crc32, haval will have back doors in place for the NSA
to access data when they see fit.

      * koconor100

You cannot sell encryption in the USA without building a back door in . It's
illegal.

        * Bri

Source?

        * Sam Doohan

Sorry, that's utterly untrue. Do men in black helicopters come and tell you to
break your freely available open source project or… What? You'll make Uncle
Sam sad? You'll disappear to a black jail? Why bother?

People outside the US would still be free create a much safer, much more
secure system that's totally available to anyone in the US via sourceforge or
github. And of course your domestic code is going to be available out there
for people to audit and look for weaknesses which have never been found
despite extreme effort to do so.

So the US government will show up and tell you to totally compromise the
purpose of your project and then sit over you and ensure you compromise it in
such a way that no-one but them will ever notice?

          * Will Ovtuth

No,they wouldn't do that but they would just participate in that open project,
like any other schlub, which is the inherit flaw and genius dichotomy of open
source.

      * cirion

Nice list. Pity that only whirlpool and GOST are "encryption technologies".
SSL ist a protocol using several actual ciphers. The rest are hash functions.
Adler-32 and CRC32 aren't even cryptographic hash functions. And no, you can't
encrypt anything with cryptographic hash functions.

If you want to impress with your knowledge, acquire some first.

        * DukeAJuke ✓σοφός

^This guy doesn't understand that hash functions are a critical component of
data encryption.. And CRC32 is indeed a hash function. Nice post bro.

          * cirion

No, they aren't. In terms of cryptography, they're good for exactly one thing:
creating a suitably random key from a human generated one. Not for encrypting
anything. Go learn how a stream or block cipher really works. You can create
hash functions from ciphers, but not the other way around.

And I said CRC32 isn't a *cryptographic* hash function, not that it isn't a
hash function at all. I suggest brushing up your reading skills as well.

    * cirion

Dude, if one-time pad encryption was a solution to *any* scenario where
encryption is really needed, we'd be using it. However, it isn't.

  * warcaster

NSA: "Just chill with plaintext everyone. Cryptography is SO DEAD, really - no
lie!"

Uh, sure.

  * IKROWNI

soooooooo, Half Life 3 confirmed?

  * Hauhet Heh

The NSA Has Quantum. They bought it from DWave. There are networks of quantum
computers. Probably in Maryland or somewhere. I recommend an encryption scheme
which comprises of both NTRU with ECC (McEliece) and AES encapsulation.
Decoding is AES, McEliece, NTRU, PT.

  * Hauhet Heh

The NSA doesn't have time travel.

  * Dustymack

This has been an issue since quantum computing became relevant. I wonder if
the government will try to control the market like they do with everything
else. We need more privet sector involvement. Its times like these where we
need stronger amendment 4 regulations. I guarantee they will use this against
citizens if they already aren't.

  * David Swanson

You always can use a Vernam cipher.

  * Will Ovtuth

I think its a reverse psychology ploy by the NSA to make their lives easier at
this point, lol. We all saw how pissed off they got when the big tech
companies wanted to encrypt phones etc…. earlier this year and with them not
being able to thwart that decision and Win 10 adoption tanking, they had to
try another angle. I highly doubt they are EVER going to do anything for OUR
benefit, that's for sure. The NSA has their own chip fabs and other
proprietary R and D sections so im pretty sure they can counter most
encryptions in short order if they want to. We really need to start
concentrating on multiple encryption/password setups to deal with the here and
now, which is ultimately the most important part of life.

  * The Real Stig

The NSA possibly got wind of Australian researchers announcing they have made
a breakthrough allowing quantum computing on silicon.

When I worked for Cadence Design Systems, the NSA was a customer of Cadence.
Of course our apps engineers were not privy to what the NSA chip designers
were doing. Based on the questions and problems the NSA engineers were having
though, it looked like they were trying to migrate their decryption algorithms
to full custom chips instead of running them on sequential Von Neumann
computers.

Not really that difficult a migration task either, since Verilog, the Cadence
Hardware Description Language, was based on the generic unix C compiler. Doing
this would allow the NSA to factor prime numbers executing in massively
parallel fashion on arrays of these custom chips…

Of course, then we can assume the NSA is reading this comment so better wear
your aluminum foil hats and run like hell if you see any black helicopters
flying around.
