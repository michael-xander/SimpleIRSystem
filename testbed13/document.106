_The potential power of quantum computing is difficult to comprehend, but its
impact is likely to be game changing in science, business and government. _

The subatomic quantum world is a magical place in which things can be both
particles and waves at the same time, where every possibility exists until we
look at it and where uncertainty is king. But scientists are increasingly
harnessing the slippery properties of this realm to build computers so
powerful they make the fastest supercomputer look like a ZX Spectrum.

Traditional computers have revolutionised the world with the deceptively
simple use of bits – binary units of information that can be either a 0 or a
1. By combining these 0s and 1s into long chains of commands, programmes can
be created which send rockets to Mars, fly aeroplanes and dredge through vast
libraries of information in less than a second.

But ever since the early 80s, when classical computing was itself still going
mainstream, physicists were speculating about the possibilities of using
quantum properties to build computers with bits other than just 0 or 1. These
quantum bits or ‘qubits’ could not only be 0 or 1 but both at the same time.
Qubits are particles like electrons, photons or single atoms – entities small
enough to exist on the quantum scale and hence take advantage of the quantum
property of ‘superposition’ – essentially being in two states at the same
time. While classical computers can only perform one operation at a time,
superposition of states allows quantum computers to perform potentially
millions of calculations in the same moment.

“You could have a whole array of qubits, like 1,000 of them,” says professor
David Lucas, head of the Ion Trap Quantum Computing team at Oxford University.
“That memory register can store something like 21,000 numbers simultaneously.
To do that in a traditional computer would require more bits than there are
atoms in the known universe.”

This kind of computational power could have massive implications. Its presence
could be particularly felt in the likes of trawling through huge sets of data,
solving complicated logistical problems and in areas such as cryptography
where complex computations are used to protect the security of private
communications like bank transactions.

Unfortunately quantum computing isn’t quite there yet. The number of qubits
being successfully manipulated is fewer than 20 – not enough to solve
computations faster than classical computers already do. This isn’t for want
of trying however. Currently, teams from Oxford to Austria and from Australia
to the US are working on making quantum computers.

At Oxford, Professor Lucas’ team is working on the ion trap method, a system
making breakthroughs in the accuracy of quantum computations. “You need very
precise operations,” says Lucas. “Putting information into these qubits and
getting it out again all needs to be done with a precision of something like
99.9 per cent. What we’re very excited about here at Oxford is that for the
first time we’ve done all the basic operations necessary to manipulate these
qubits with this 99.9 per cent precision just within the last year.”

The snag is that the team can only achieve this accuracy using just one or two
qubits. Elsewhere, teams are working with less accuracy but more qubits. The
record so far, according to Lucas, is held by a team in Innsbruck in Austria,
which has managed to manipulate 14 qubits.

That was until a small Canadian start up called D-Wave stepped in. D-Wave
claimed they had solved a computation with more than 14 qubits. And they
weren’t just claiming a couple more, or ten more, or even 100 more qubits.
Those at D-Wave were claiming to use 1,000 more qubits.

Standing taller than a human and clad all in black, the imposing D-Wave 2X
computer looks like it might turn sentient at any moment and go quickly about
the business of taking over the world. “Quantum computing is going to move
business, science, and government forward in unprecedented ways,” says Murray
Thom, D-Waves’ director of professional services. “It’s all a matter of
solving problems that are too complex for today’s computational systems. This
innovation could lead to the exploration of new and cleaner sources of energy,
superior image recognition, more accurate financial forecasting and precise
genome mapping.”

There are a few issues though, the most serious being that most scientists
don’t believe the D-Wave is really a quantum computer. Tests carried out by
Matthias Troyer, a computer scientist at the Institute for Theoretical Physics
in Zurich, found that D-Wave didn’t perform faster than classical computers
over a range of specific computations. But D-Wave claims the slow performance
was caused by calibration errors in the test. In any case, the scepticism of
the scientific community hasn’t stopped big organisations taking on the D-Wave
technology. NASA has bought a machine, as has Google, and Lockheed Martin is
using a D-Wave computer to test its flight control systems.

Professor Lucas remains sceptical but he does predict that advances in quantum
computing will accelerate in the near future, especially with the funding it’s
currently receiving (the UK government alone has pledged £270 million over the
next five years). “It looks like at the moment the only limitation is
technical barriers,” says Lucas, “and how fast you get through a technical
barrier often depends on how many resources you throw at it.”

So does he see a fully functioning quantum computer coming so? “It’s not going
to happen in 10 years,” he says, “but I’ll be surprised if it hasn’t happened
in 50”.

DRIVING CARSSelf-driving cars are complex, and the engineering involves a fair
bit of machine learning. This allows them to automatically process large data
streams while maintaining stable control in a real environment. Training and
operating this software often involves optimising mathematical models like
neural networks. D-Wave systems can be thought of as human-made neural
networks that use quantum mechanics.SAFER AEROPLANES

A big issue in the flight industry is certifying that the control software is
thoroughly tested; it’s an exhaustive and time-consuming process. These are
incredibly complex systems and testing and validating the software is one of
the biggest expenses of a new aircraft project. Lockheed has been using a
D-Wave system to find faster, better ways to make safer airplanes more
efficiently.

MORE EFFECTIVE DRUGS

Understanding the behaviour of proteins is a key factor in drug development.
Simulating the folding of proteins effectively could significantly enhance our
understanding of complex biological systems and our ability to design powerful
new drugs. Quantum computing may have a unique ability to explore the
multitudes of possible folding configurations of these interesting molecules,
leading to a deeper understanding of the best pharmaceutical solutions.”

FINDING NEW PLANETS

One application where quantum computers could make a contribution is the
Kepler search for habitable planets. It’s a big search and data analysis
problem, one where a quantum computer could be better at classifying observed
characteristics that a classical algorithm would overlook.

OTHER APPLICATIONS?

There are many applications for quantum computing in terms of space
exploration and logistics, healthcare and finance. Any problem where
individuals are trying to find the optimal solution of many discrete variables
could be a good application for D- Wave systems.
