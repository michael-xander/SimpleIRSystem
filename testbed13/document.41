Did you drop something in that AGAIN?

NASA

Very occasionally, my imagination gets the better of me. When I encountered a
paper entitled "How to Recover a Qubit That Has Fallen into a Black Hole," I
envisioned a typical lab experiment. One student, having been given a precious
quantum state, accidentally drops it into a black hole—"accidentally" in the
same way that you accidentally break into the chemistry supplies cupboard and
mix everything together under a fume hood just to see what will happen. Never
mind, says the clearly annoyed lab instructor, who then performs some arcane
maneuvers and recovers the carelessly handled qubit.

Reality has fewer students dropping quantum states into black holes but makes
up for it with an excess of equally amusing theoretical physicists. The idea
behind studying how to recover a qubit from a black hole is not to help future
students avert a lab disaster but to understand the quantum state of a black
hole.

Black holes are rather coy about what they have under their event horizons.
Nothing that we send into a black hole is coming back, so the only information
that comes directly from a black hole is the Hawking radiation it emits.

## A short history of Hawking radiation

Hawking radiation is emitted at a black hole's event horizon—the radius at
which the gravitational pull is sufficient to prevent light from escaping. One
way in which Hawking radiation is thought to be generated is through vacuum
fluctuations. The vacuum is not empty; it teams with virtual particles that
are continuously created in pairs. One in the pair has a positive energy, the
other a negative energy. These pairs never escape the vicinity of their
creation before they collide and annihilate each other.

At the event horizon of a black hole, the particle with negative energy can
fall into the black hole, while its positive-energy partner doesn’t. As a
result, the mass of the black hole falls slightly, and we observe some
radiation.

The important thing about Hawking radiation for the purposes of this
discussion is that pairs of particles generated through vacuum fluctuations
are entangled in many different ways.

During creation, the total energy, momentum, and angular momentum must be
conserved. (We often refer to the intrinsic angular momentum of a particle as
spin, and it has just two values: spin-up or spin-down.) The vacuum these
particles came from has no average energy, momentum, or angular momentum, so
the particles can’t either. Since there are two of them, the sum of their
energies has to be zero, and so on. And since the particles don’t come with
labels saying which particle got what values, we must treat them as a single,
extended object.

For spin, the total should be zero, meaning that both particles should be in a
superposition of spin-up and spin-down—the particle that falls into the black
hole is in both spin-up and spin-down states, while the particle that exits
the black hole is also in both spin-up and spin-down states. When we measure
the spin of one, we automatically set the spin of both.

It's not the case that the spin was really set beforehand, and the only reason
we didn’t know is that we hadn’t measured it yet. When we attempt to predict
the behavior of the particle _before_ the measurement, we only succeed if we
consider the particle to be in both spin states simultaneously, which we call
a superposition state. It really is a case of being both here and there at the
same time.

## Let’s get all the actors on stage

Here's the scene: we have a student who is going to accidentally-on-purpose
drop a qubit into a black hole. The qubit is in a superposition state—until we
measure it, it must be treated like it is in both spin-up and spin-down
states.

We have a friendly black hole that has some angular momentum, and every now
and again, it emits some Hawking radiation. The Hawking radiation is not just
in a superposition state (like the qubit), but is also entangled. And because
one of the pair particles is falling into the black hole, it will modify the
angular momentum of the black hole. Here's the key part: because that particle
was entangled, the change in angular momentum can be entangled with the spin
of the Hawking radiation, provided the right set of measurements are
performed. If we do this, when we measure the Hawking radiation’s spin, we
also set the change in the spin of the black hole.

Finally, we have our intrepid lab instructor, who is prepared to save our
hapless lab student from disaster.

## Getting prepared

Every good lab instructor is prepared for disaster, and our hero is no
exception. Anticipating disaster, the instructor measures the angular momentum
of the black hole. This process involves flying the black hole between the
poles of a magnet and measuring how far and in which direction the magnet
deflects it. Or, since the black hole might prove to be rather massive, it
could be easier to measure the deflection of the magnetic poles as they fly
past the black hole. Lab instructors get to play with the coolest equipment
sometimes.

Once that's done, the instructor collects a single photon of Hawking radiation
from the black hole and performs the right measurements to set up an entangled
spin state between it and the black hole.

This display of technical prowess so awes the student that they drop their
qubit, which falls into the black hole. The lab instructor, after much eye
rolling, measures the total angular momentum of the black hole once again.

Depending on the measurement, there are several possible outcomes, one of
which is that the measurement tells the instructor that the Hawking radiation
collected earlier is now in the same state as the qubit that was dropped into
the hole. In this case, the instructor can simply pass the Hawking radiation
to the student (with an admonishment to be more careful with this one).

The other outcomes require more work on the lab instructor's part: typically,
creating a new entangled state and tossing one of the entangled particles into
the black hole or additional measurements of the black hole’s angular
momentum. But in two-thirds of the cases, the Hawking radiation ends up in the
qubit’s state.

In the remaining cases, the qubit cannot be recovered. But a sufficiently
well-prepared lab instructor can avoid this as well. When performing the
measurement on the Hawking radiation to create the right entangled state, the
result of the measurement also predicts success. At this point, the lab
instructor can throw away the Hawking radiation and start again.

## Well, that seems doable, doesn’t it?

Apart from the all the practical problems, how realistic is it to deliberately
throw qubits into a black hole to learn something about it? One issue is that
the time it takes to emit Hawking radiation has to be faster than the time it
takes a qubit to be scrambled by the black hole. Both of these terms depend on
the mass of the black hole. The authors estimate that a black hole without
much angular momentum would have to be larger than the observable Universe for
this to be satisfied. So, this can only work with black holes that have a huge
amount of angular momentum.

What do we learn about the internal quantum state of a black hole? Nothing, at
least not yet. The idea here is that the qubit has entered the black hole, and
we have recovered that information after it has passed the event
horizon—something we couldn’t do before. At the moment, we only get out what
we put in, but maybe some additional cleverness will allow other information
to be extracted.
