In the same way as it is possible in the everyday world to get big rolling
waves in the sea with tiny ripples superimposed on them, it is also possible
in the sub-atomic world for a combination or superposition of waves to exist.

Schrdingers theory of probability waves permits the existence of two or more
waves. In the example from the previous section of light shining on an
imperfectly transparent sheet of glass, one wave would correspond to a photon
passing through the glass and another wave would correspond to the photon
bouncing back. But it is also possible for both waves to have superposed
waves, which leads to the possibility of the photon being both transmitted AND
reflected, and therefore being on both sides of the glass simultaneously!

In fact, this leads to the possibility of a potentially unlimited number of
superposed waves, which means that microscopic particles can theoretically be
located in a potentially unlimited number of places at once, and to behave in
a potentially unlimited number of different ways. Just one of the intriguing
possibilities this idea suggests is in the realm of computing, for example,
where a "quantum computer" (still largely hypothetical at this time) could
take advantage of an atoms ability to be in a superposition of states to
produce prodigiously increased power and speed of calculations.

Double-slit experiment with a single photon  
(Source: P.E.A.C.E.: http://www.peace-files.com/QF-L-11/01_QF-Double-
slit.html)  
  
---  
  
Interestingly, a modern incarnation of Thomas Youngs double-slit experiment
using a very feeble light source that spits out one photon at a time, leads to
the same evidence of interference, even though there are no waves as such to
interfere with each other. The only way the single photons can experience
interference, then, is if each photon somehow goes though both slits
simultaneously (due to superposition) and interferes with itself! The entire
experiment can in fact be performed with electrons, atoms or other sub-atomic
particles instead of light, demonstrating that ALL particles manifest both
wave and particle aspects (this interference is the mechanism by which a
hypothetical quantum computer would combine its multiple calculations into one
answer).

In 1978, John Wheeler proposed a variation of Youngs double-slit experiment
(and Richard Feynmans later refinements of it), often referred to as the
"delayed choice experient. He posited that the detection of a photon even
AFTER passing through a double slit would be sufficient to change the outcome
of the experiment and the behaviour of the photon. Therefore, if the
experimenters know which slit it goes through, the photon will behave as a
particle, rather than as a wave with its associated interference behaviour.
This somewhat counter-intuitive hypothesis was finally verified in a practical
experiment in 2007.

It should be noted that, in reality, superpositions can never actually be
observed - all we can see is the consequences of their existence, after
individual waves of a superposition interfere with each other. Thus, we can
never observe an atom in its indeterminate state, or being in two places at
once, only the resulting consequences, and physical reality is not determined
until the act of measurement takes place and solidifies the situation into one
state or another.

Part of the problem of observing and measuring superpositions is known as
decoherence. Any attempt to measure or obtain knowledge of quantum
superpositions by the outside world (or indeed any kind of interaction with
their environment, even with just a single photon) causes them to decohere,
effectively destroying the superposition and reducing it to a single location
or state, and also destroying the ability of its individual states to
interfere with each other. Decoherence, then, results in the collapse of the
quantum wave function and the settling of a particle into its observed state
under classical physics, its transition from quantum to classical behaviour.

Decoherence is also the main reason that quantum theory really only applies in
practice to the sub-atomic world: in the large-scale world in which we live,
it is all but impossible to isolate anything from interaction with its
environment, especially given the countless trillions of photons bouncing off
every object all the time. Even an object made of just 60 atoms requires
extreme cold to prevent it from becoming classical rather than "quantum". It
is the interaction of quantum objects with the environment that produces what
we understand as classical objects, such as cats and tables. Thus, in practice
we never observe a quantum system directly; we only observe its effect on its
environment.

Artist's impression of Schrdinger's Cat thought experiment  
(Source: Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrodinger%27s_cat)  
  
---  
  
In 1935, the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrdinger devised his famous thought
experiment or paradox, known as Schrdingers cat, to graphically illustrate the
problem of decoherence (and to illustrate the general bizarreness of quantum
mechanics). He proposed a scenario with a cat in a sealed box, where the cat's
life or death was dependent on the state of a particular sub-atomic particle.
According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the cat is in a kind of limbo
represented by a wave function which contains the possibility that the cat is
dead but also the possibility that it is alive. The cat, then, remains both
alive AND dead until the box is opened, i.e. a superposition. This is usually
taken as a demonstration of the way that quantum physics breaks down when
dealing with large objects.

Although the best known and most popular view, the Copenhagen interpretation
is, however, not the only interpretation of the quantum world. Some
scientists, going back to Hugh Everett III in 1957 and subsequently championed
by Bryce DeWitt and many others, have hypothesized that each possible state of
a superposition actually exists in a totally separate parallel reality, which
are all part of a potentially infinite multiverse, the so-called many worlds
interpretation. Thus, every indeterminism in a quantum system generates a
multifoliate reality in which the universe is continually branching into
myriads of physically disconnected (but equally real) parallel universes.

This view purports to explain many of the apparently inexplicable properties
of quantum theory. For example, the experimentally-proven phenomenon whereby
individual photons going through a slit mysteriously experience interefence,
may be explained in the many worlds interpretation by interference from
photons in other parallel universes. It may also provide explanations for some
of the more intractible problems of the Big Bang theory - for example, see the
section on Superstrings and Quantum Gravity.

Unlike the Copenhagen interpretation (in which consciousness actually
influences reality), the many worlds intepretation requires no observers to
shape reality, since it is not necessary to collapse a wave function to
actualize the universe, and every reality that CAN conceivably exist is
automatically created. On the down side, however, the many worlds hypothesis
is about as extravagant as it is possible to get, quite the opposite of the
principle of parsimony, often referred to as Occams Razor, which dictates that
theories should be constructed using the least possible number of principles
and assumptions. And, of course, if parallel universes are independent and
separate from our own, there is not, and indeed never will be, any way of
practically proving their existence.

Illustration of the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics  
(Source: Reality Shifters: http://realityshifters.com/pages/  
articles/retrocausalrs.html)  
  
---  
  
In 1986, John Cramer proposed another alternative interpretation of quantum
physics, which many people feel overcomes the drawbacks of both the standard
Copenhagen interpretation and the many worlds interpretation, and resolves
many quantum paradoxes. Known as the "transactional interpretation", Cramer
described quantum interactions as involving both a wave going forwards in time
and a wave gong backwards in time.

According to the transactional interpretation, in any quantum transation (such
as the propagation of an electromagnetic wave between two particles, for
example), the receiving particles backward wave reinforces the emitting
particles forward wave so long as it is between the particles, but it cancels
out the emitting particles own backward wave (which is why a backward wave is
not seen before the emission); and the receiving particles forward wave also
cancels out the emitting particles forward wave (which is why a forward wave
is not preceived after the receiving particle has absorbed it). Thus, the
particles interact in the way called for by quantum physics (including the
collapse of the wave packet, etc) without requiring an act of measurement by
an external observer, allowing for the existence of a "real world" out there
independent of us. The interpretation has it critics, but has gained much
traction since its initial proposal.

There are also many other competing interpretations of quantum theory,
including the consistent histories interpretation, the ensemble
interpretation, relational quantum mechanics, stochastic mechanics, objective
collapse theories, the many minds interpretation, the modal interpretation,
and several others. It remains a highly active (and controversial) area of
modern physics.
