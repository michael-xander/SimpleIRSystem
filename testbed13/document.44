# Does time dilation destroy quantum superposition?

Jun 19, 2015 3 comments

  
Does gravity play a key role in destroying quantum superpositions?

Why do we not see everyday objects in quantum superpositions? The answer to
that long-standing question may partly lie with gravity. So says a group of
physicists in Austria, which has shown theoretically that a feature of
Einstein's general relativity, known as time dilation, can render quantum
states classical. The researchers say that even the Earth's puny gravitational
field may be strong enough for the effect to be measurable in a laboratory
within a few years.

Our daily experience suggests that there exists a fundamental boundary between
the quantum and classical worlds. One way that physicists explain the
transition between the two, is to say that quantum superposition states simply
break down when a system exceeds a certain size or level of complexity - its
wavefunction is said to "collapse" and the system becomes "decoherent".

### Complex wavefunction

An alternative explanation, in which quantum mechanics holds sway at all
scales, posits that interactions with the environment bring different elements
of an object's wavefunction out of phase, such that they no longer interfere
with one another. Larger objects are subject to this decoherence more quickly
than smaller ones because they have more constituent particles and, therefore,
more complex wavefunctions.

There are already multiple different explanations for decoherence, including a
particle emitting or absorbing electromagnetic radiation or being buffeted by
surrounding air molecules. In the latest work, Časlav Brukner at the
University of Vienna and colleagues have put forward a new model that involves
time dilation - where the flow of time is affected by mass (gravity). This
relativistic effect allows for a clock in outer space to tick at a faster rate
than one near the surface of the Earth.

### Dilating states

In their work, Brukner and colleagues consider a macroscopic body - whose
constituent particles can vibrate at different frequencies - to be in a
superposition of two states at very slightly different distances from the
surface of a massive object. Time dilation would then dictate that the state
closer to the object will vibrate at a lower frequency than the other. They
then calculate how much time dilation is needed to differentiate the
frequencies so that the two states get out of step with one another, so much
that they can no longer interfere.

With this premise, the team worked out that even the Earth's gravitational
field is strong enough to cause decoherence in quite small objects across
measurable timescales. The researchers calculated that an object that weighs a
gram and exists in two quantum states, separated vertically by a thousandth of
a millimetre, should decohere in around a millisecond.

Beyond any potential quantum-computing applications that would benefit from
the removal of unwanted decoherence, the work challenges physicists'
assumption that only gravitational fields generated by neutron stars and other
massive astrophysical objects can exert a noticeable influence on quantum
phenomena. "The interesting thing about this phenomenon is that both quantum
mechanics and general relativity would be needed to explain it," says Brukner.

### Quantum clocks

One way to experimentally test the effect would involve sending a "clock"
(such as a beam of caesium atoms) through the two arms of an interferometer.
The interferometer would initially be positioned horizontally and the
interference pattern recorded. It would then be rotated to the vertical, such
that one arm experiences a higher gravitational potential than the other, and
its output again observed. In the latter case, the two states vibrate at
different frequencies due to time dilation. This different rate of ticking
would reveal which state is travelling down each arm, and once this
information is revealed, the interference pattern disappears.

"People have already measured time dilation due to Earth's gravity," says
Brukner, "but they usually use two clocks in two different positions. We are
saying, why not use one clock in a superposition?" Carrying out such a test,
however, will not be easy. The fact that the effect is far smaller than other
potential sources of decoherence would mean cooling the interferometer down to
just a few kelvin while enclosing it in a vacuum, says Brukner.

The measurements would still be extremely tricky, according to Markus Arndt,
at the University of Vienna, who was not involved in the current work. He says
they could require superpositions around a million times bigger and 1000 times
longer lasting than is possible with the best equipment today. Nevertheless,
Arndt praises the proposal for "directing attention" towards the interface
between quantum mechanics and gravity. He also points out that any
improvements to interferometers needed for this work could also have practical
benefits, such as allowing improved tests of relativity or enhancing tools for
geodesy.

The research is published in _Nature Physics_.

### A Possible Clue - with Problems

> The intro accurately discusses what Austrian physicists claim.  
  
After that the article goes off the rails a bit:  
\- "our daily experience" includes no experience of the quantum realm;  
\- that the "quantum superposition states" can be said to ***explain***
"transition" of "two [existential] worlds" is dubious unless one can link
maths to fundamental reality - a trick which, to my knowledge, has yet to be
achieved;  
  
While the linkage proposed seems to represent a possible avenue for progress,
from the perspective of optimizing resource allocation to complete the
Einsteinian Revolution, the researchers' time is better invested in trying to
mathematically reinterpret object concepts of their paradigms: mass, particle,
force, space-time, etc.

### Most of the mass comes from the complexity

> I would like to mention the famous equation m = E / c^2  
  
As you all know, the energy of a complex system of elementary particles
divided by c^2 gives the additional mass to the system. In total, the mass of
the system is the mass of the elementary particles plus the additional mass.  
  
Recently, I enjoyed a lecture that continues this old story on to the modern
views on the quarks, gluons and the Higgs field.  
  
So, it is is claimed that the additional mass that depends from the mutual
relationship of the constituent particles, is considerable in the microscopic
systems such as the atoms and especially protons and neutrons.  
  
The additional mass also adds to the general relativistic effects such as the
curvature of spacetime (which includes the time dilation). Thus, larger
systems would exhibit more GR effects and decohere if the gravity is
destructive per se. (Maybe there could be made some experiment with the atom
of Gold.)  
  
By this line of reasoning, more complex systems could be fiddling with their
own masses by changing their structure. However, if they are closed (E =
const), then their mass is constant to a distant observer.  
  
No matter what the system's inner dynamics is, the inner transformations of
energy (presumably oscillations) do not disturb the constancy of the total
mass.  
  
The same clocks taken to different heights possess different energies and
masses. As the articles claim, they do not synchronize in a manner required to
keep the coherence, loosely speaking, or a single clock does not remain in the
state of superposition. Confoundingly, the decoherence means that there is a
change of mass.

> You are right that there is a change of mass, but it is easier to think of
as a change of energy. If you have a pair of photons at the same frequency and
move one further from the earth's center, the more distant photon will appear
to the original photon as having an energy augmented by the increase in
gravitational potential energy. Integrate the gravitational tensor along a
radial path and you get U=mgh right out of freshman physics. That's where the
extra mass-energy and the frequency change comes from.
