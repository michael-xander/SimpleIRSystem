# Google's Quantum Computer Proven To Be Real Thing (Almost)

Google bought one. So did Lockheed Martin, one of the world's largest defense
contractors. But we still can't agree on what it is they bought.

D-Wave, the company that built the thing, calls it the world's first quantum
computer, a seminal creation that foretells the future of mathematical
calculation. But many of the world's experts see it quite differently, arguing
the D-Wave machine is something other than the computing holy grail the
scientific community has sought since the mid-1980s.

No doubt, the argument will continue. But today, researchers at the University
of Southern California published a paper that comes that much closer to
showing the D-Wave is indeed a quantum computer. USC houses and operates the
D-Wave system owned by Lockheed, and the researchers -- led by Daniel Lidar, a
professor of electrical engineering, chemistry, and physics -- say they have
at least shown the machine is _not_ using a computing model known as
"simulated annealing," which obeys the laws of classical physics (the physics
of everyday life) rather than the more elusive properties of quantum physics.

"[Our research] rules out one type of classical model that has been argued as
a proper description of the D-Wave machine," Lidar says. "A lot of people
thought that when D-Wave came on the market their machine was just doing that,
[but] we ruled that out."

'Our research rules out one type of classical model that has been argued as a
proper description of the D-Wave machine. A lot of people thought that when
D-Wave came on the market their machine was just doing that, but we ruled that
out.'

— Daniel Lidar

The paper, _Experimental Signature of Programmable Quantum Annealing_, appears
in the well-respected academic journal _Nature Communications_. Quantum
annealing is a computing model that, yes, operates in the quantum realm, and
according to Lidar, the team's research shows "strong agreement" between
quantum annealing and the way the D-Wave system operates.

First proposed in 1985 by British physicist David Deutsch, a quantum computer
is a machine that operates according to the mind-bending principles of quantum
mechanics, the physics of very small things like electrons and photons. With a
classical computer, a transistor stores a single "bit" of information. If the
transistor is "on," it holds a "1." If it’s "off," it holds a "0." With
quantum computer, information is held in a system that can exist in two states
_at the same time_, thanks to what's called the superposition principle of
quantum mechanics.

This "qubit" can store a "0" and "1" simultaneously. If you build two qubits,
they can hold four values at once -- 00, 01, 10, and 11. As you tack on
additional qubits, you can fashion a machine exponentially more powerful than
a classical computer.

The rub is building even a single qubit is difficult. When you look at -- i.e.
read information from -- a quantum system, it decoheres. In other words, it
turns into an ordinary bit capable of holding only a single value. It ceases
to be a quantum computer.

There are many ways around this problem, and the minds at D-Wave, including
founder and CTO Geordie Rose, believe they've found one. In 2007, the company
released what it called a 16-qubit quantum computer, and the company's current
model is billed as a 512-qubit machine. This is what Google is using.

According to D-Wave, the machine contains 512 superconducting circuits, each a
tiny loop of flowing current. These are cooled to almost absolute zero, the
company says, so they enter a quantum state where the current flows both
clockwise and counterclockwise at the same time. When you feed the machine a
task, it uses a set of algorithms to map a calculation across these qubits --
and then execute that calculation. Basically, this involves determining the
probability that a given set of circuits will emerge in a particular pattern
when the temperature inside the system is raised.

But scientists such as Greg Kuperberg, a math professor at the University of
California, Davis, are skeptical. "D-Wave’s technology has been an enigma, in
a negative sense," he told us last year. The USC paper gets us a little closer
to the truth, though Lidar and his team still leave room for doubt over the
way the machine operates.

What they can say for sure is that the system doesn't use simulated annealing,
which is essentially a means of searching for a mathematical solution.
According to Lidar, simulated annealing is akin to looking for the lowest
possible point in a vast landscape.

"We call it an energy landscape," he says. "There is a solution hiding
somewhere in that landscape, and you can imagine that solution is hiding at
the lowest point on the surface. You're trying to find that lowest point."
This is done by randomly traveling across the landscape, moving down "hills"
and back up them, until you locate the deepest valley.

This strategy relies purely on classical physics, not quantum physics. But
Lidar says the D-wave is "consistent" with quantum annealing. This is similar
to simulated annealing -- except you can, in essence, _go through the hills_
rather than over them. "You can take advantage of a quantum phenomenon called
tunneling," Lidar says. "It's like a quantum shortcut." He's careful to say
that he and his team have not proven that the D-Wave uses quantum annealing,
but the system certainly appears to use it.

Even if they did prove the machine operates in this way, this wouldn't exactly
prove it's a quantum computer. When those in the scientific community hear the
term, they tend to think of a "universal quantum computer," a quantum computer
that can handle any task. The D-Wave doesn't work that way -- it's geared to
particular calculations -- but according to Lidar, the concepts behind it
could be used, in theory, to build a universal quantum computer.

Whatever you call it, the D-Wave is useful, helping to solve what are known as
combinatorial optimization problems, which turn up in everything from genome
sequence analysis and protein folding to risk analysis. In announcing its use
of the D-Wave machine last month, Google said it would use the system to help
advance machine learning -- i.e. efforts to create computing systems that can
learn in much the same way people do.

"We believe quantum computing may help solve some of the most challenging
computer science problems, particularly in machine learning," Hartmut Neven, a
Google director of engineering, wrote in a blog post. "Machine learning is all
about building better models of the world to make more accurate predictions."

For what it's worth, Google is matter-of-fact in calling the D-Wave a quantum
computer. And it should come as no surprise that it just hired Sergio Boixo,
one of the researchers behind the USC paper. The machine is housed at NASA's
Ames Research Center, not far from Google's headquarters, in a place the
company calls the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab. At Google, the
semantics aren't nearly as important as the task at hand.
