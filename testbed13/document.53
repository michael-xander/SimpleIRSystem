IBM's five five qubit processorIBM Research

Quantum computing is computing at its most esoteric. It's an experimental,
enormously complex, sometimes downright confusing technology that's typically
the domain of hardcore academics and organizations like Google and NASA. But
that might be changing.

Today, IBM unveiled an online service that lets anyone use the five-qubit
quantum computer its researchers have erected at a research lab in Yorktown
Heights, New York. You can access the machine over the Internet via a simple
software interface--or at least it's simple if you understand the basics of
quantum computing. This new service is hardly something the everyday consumer
will use, but it's a big deal for the many researchers now working to build a
practical quantum computer--a computer that moves beyond just 1s and 0s to
become exponentially more powerful than today's machines. In that sense, IBM
is indeed striving to bring quantum computing to the world at large.

'I think that someone out there will learn things about the behavior of this
quantum computer that its developers never thought of.'

Yes, the service is a way for IBM to show off its quantum computer, to have
outsiders verify and approve its work--something that's particularly important
when you're dealing with the hard-to-pin-down dynamics of quantum systems. But
David DiVincenzo, a professor at the Institute for Quantum Information at RWTH
Aachen University and one of quantum computing's earliest pioneers, believes
the service will lead to more. "I think that someone out there will learn
things about the behavior of this quantum computer," he says, "that its
developers never thought of."

That's an important thing as researchers seek to unlock new realms of
technology with this kind of machine, including everything from understanding
DNA sequences to predicting the rise and fall of the stock market. Some aim to
simulate the way individual molecules interact, while others hope that quantum
computers will extend the reach of machine learning. That's what Google and
NASA are exploring with their $10 million D-Wave machine, a somewhat
controversial creation that exhibits quantum properties in at least some
situations.

### Meet the Qubit

Today's computers store data in extremely small transistors. Each transistor
can hold a single "bit" of information: a 1 or a 0. But about thirty years
ago, scientists proposed a machine that could go beyond that binary, a machine
that could store data in a system that obeys the seemingly magical principles
of quantum mechanics. Instead of just a 1 or a 0, a "qubit" could store both
_at the same time_, thanks to what's called the superposition principle.

By extension, two qubits could hold four values simultaneously: 00, 01, 10,
and 11. And if you keep adding qubits, you could, in theory, build a machine
far more powerful than any that exists today. "These are things you can't
explain with regular logic," says Jerry Chow, the former Yale researcher who
helps oversee IBM's quantum computing work. "Quantum computing and quantum
algorithms are all about: how do you harness that?"

But that kind of ultra-powerful machine doesn't yet exist. Qubits, you see,
are slippery things. If you try to observe the state of a quantum system, it
"decoheres," falling into one state or the other. It no longer holds both a 0
and a 1. It holds only a O or a 1, like the classical computers of today. To
build a true quantum computer, researchers must harness the probability that a
qubit will decohere into one state versus the other.

### The Same Result Each Time

There are many ways of doing this, and though none has truly cracked the
problem, some are quite promising. IBM has built a quantum computer that
operates by dropping superconducting circuits into an enormous sub-zero
refrigerator, and it spans five qubits. But now, in sharing this machine with
the world at large, the company hopes to accelerate its progress, aiming to
extend its power to 50 or possibly 100 qubits.

These are things you can't explain with regular logic. Jerry Chow, IBM

According to David Cory, a professor with the University of Waterloo's
Institute for Quantum Computing, this sort of online quantum computer--a
quantum cloud service, if you will--is pretty much unprecedented. Building
such a service, he explains, is far more difficult than you might expect.
"It's not a simple thing to do," he says. "Quantum systems are really quite
delicate."

And, he adds, IBM has done it right. The service is fronted by an interface
that's remarkably easy to use. "Any student that has a first introduction to
quantum computing would understand how to interact with this device," Cory
says.

Cory spent the weekend using the new service, and what struck him was that the
system was so consistent--that it reached the pretty much same result each
time he ran a test. That's not a big deal in the world of classical computing.
Your laptop does that countless times a second. But in the world of quantum
computing, which is all about capturing probabilities, consistency is a sign
of progress. Now, with this service available to the larger community, perhaps
more progress is on the way.
