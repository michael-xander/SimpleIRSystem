# A real supercomputer

scitech/technology/news /

28 December 2015 at 14:00pm

_By:_ **Dominic Basulto**

Ever since the 1980s, researchers have been working on the development of a
quantum computer that would be exponentially more powerful than any of the
digital computers that exist today. And now Google, in collaboration with
NASA, says it has a quantum computer - the D-Wave 2X - that works.

Google claims the D-Wave 2X is 100 million times as fast as any of today's
machines. As a result, this quantum computer could theoretically complete
calculations within seconds to a problem that might take a digital computer
10,000 years to calculate. That's particularly important, given the difficult
tasks that today's computers are called upon to complete and the staggering
amount of data they are called upon to process.

On the surface, the D-Wave 2X represents a quantum leap not just for computing
but also for the field of artificial intelligence. In fact, Google refers to
its work being carried out at NASA's Ames Research Center as "quantum
artificial intelligence." That's because problems that are too hard or too
complex for today's machines could be solved almost instantaneously in the
future.

Because of the specifics of how Google's quantum computer works - a process
known as quantum annealing - the immediate applications for Google's quantum
computer are a class of A.I. problems generally referred to as optimization
problems. Imagine NASA being able to use quantum computers to optimize the
flight trajectories of interstellar space missions, FedEx being able to
optimize its delivery fleet of trucks and planes, an airport being able to
optimize its air-traffic control grid, the military being able to crack any
encryption code, or a Big Pharma company being able to optimize its search for
a breakthrough new drug.

You get the idea - the new Google quantum computer could potentially be worth
millions, if not billions, to certain types of companies or government
agencies.

Moreover, consumers might also benefit from the development of quantum
artificial intelligence. In a promotional video for its Quantum Artificial
Intelligence Lab, Google suggests that travel might be one type of consumer
optimization problem worth pursuing. Imagine planning a trip to Europe,
selecting which cities you'd like to visit, telling a computer how much you'd
like to pay, and then having Google optimize the perfect trip itinerary for
you.

There's just one little problem with all this: Quantum computers are
notoriously difficult beasts to tame. With quantum computers, you're dealing
with quantum bits ("qubits"), not digital bits. Unlike digital bits, which are
binary (either 1 or 0), a qubit could be either - or both at the same time.
That means you have to deal with all the quirky properties of particles
predicted by quantum mechanics in order to program quantum computers
correctly.

Oh, and each 10-foot-high D-Wave computer also needs to be super-chilled to a
temperature that's 150 times as cold as that of deep space, making them pretty
much inaccessible to anyone who hasn't been stockpiling liquid helium.

And that's where the A.I. contest comes into play. IBM, for instance, has a
digital supercomputer - IBM Watson - that also wants to play the A.I.
optimization game. IBM Watson also wants to optimize the research and
development process for pharmaceutical researchers to find new cures. And IBM
Watson wants to play in the consumer realm, where it's already at work
optimizing the training regimens of top-flight athletes.



**The other competitors**

And it's not just Google D-Wave vs. IBM Watson in some ultimate cage match to
see which is better and faster at optimizing solutions to hard problems; it's
all the other classes of unconventional computers out there. Consider, for
example, the new memcomputer, which mimics the way the human brain works,
storing and processing information simultaneously. There are plenty of other
unconventional computers, too, including some that are biological. And other
research labs and universities - such as at the University of Maryland or Yale
University, which recently launched the Yale Quantum Institute - are working
on their own quantum computers.

What all this points to is that traditional digital computing (what Google
refers to as "classical computing") is on the way out. We're now looking for a
new heir apparent, and Google hopes to anoint D-Wave as the rightful heir.
With its big announcement that quantum computing can work, Google hopes to
show that they've figured out how to make practical quantum computers for the
commercial market.

Anytime you claim to have created something that's 100 million times as fast
as anything else that's ever existed, though, you're bound to run up against
skeptics. Indeed, there are plenty of skeptics for the D-Wave. One big quibble
about the quantum qubits, for example, is that the test results were not
nearly as impressive as Google claims they were. That's because the digital
computer trying to defeat the quantum computer was forced to compete under
Google's house rules, which meant that it had to use the same algorithm that
the quantum computer used - and that algorithm had already been carefully
sculpted to the peculiarities of the quantum world. Imagine running a race
against a competitor in shoes that are too big, pants that keep falling down,
and on a course where your competitor can run across and through the track -
not just around it.

**The way forward**

Going forward, it's possible to think of two vastly different scenarios for
quantum computing. The first scenario is that Google uses these D-Wave quantum
computers to corner the market in artificial intelligence. Just as once nobody
could have predicted that everyone would own his own personal computer one
day, maybe people will all own their own quantum computer one day.

The other scenario is that the world moves on to other forms of computing,
perhaps using components that are easier to program than qubits. Maybe quantum
computers are just too quirky, too hard to program, to solve the types of
problems most people want to solve. Quantum computers may be able to optimize
an entire nation's air-traffic control grid or fly a spacecraft to Mars, but
what if you just want to check your phone to know what to wear to work
tomorrow?

Either way, the future of artificial intelligence will never be the same.
Thanks to exponential gains in computing power on the horizon, it's becoming
increasingly clear that today's digital computers have the potential to become
obsolete. Let's just hope that tomorrow's super-powerful quantum computers
don't become transcendent and try to take over the world.
