Peter ffoulkes, OrionX.net

The world of quantum computing frequently seems as bizarre as the alternate
realities created in Lewis Carroll’s masterpieces “Alice’s Adventures in
Wonderland” and “Through the Looking-Glass”. Carroll (Charles Lutwidge
Dodgson) was a well-respected mathematician and logician in addition to being
a photographer and enigmatic author.

**Has quantum computing’s time actually come or are we just chasing rabbits?**

That is probably a twenty million dollar question by the time a D-Wave 2X™
System has been installed and is in use by a team of researchers. Publicly
disclosed installations currently include Lockheed Martin, NASA's Ames
Research Center and Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Hosted at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California, the Quantum Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory (QuAIL) supports a collaborative effort among NASA,
Google and the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) to explore the
potential for quantum computers to tackle optimization problems that are
difficult or impossible for traditional supercomputers to handle. Researchers
on NASA’s QuAIL team are using the system to investigate areas where quantum
algorithms might someday dramatically improve the agency's ability to solve
difficult optimization problems in aeronautics, Earth and space sciences, and
space exploration.  For Google the goal is to study how quantum computing
might advance machine learning. The USRA manages access for researchers from
around the world to share time on the system.

**Using quantum annealing to solve optimization problems**

D-Wave's quantum annealing technology addresses optimization and probabilistic
sampling problems by framing them as energy minimization problems and
exploiting the properties of quantum physics to identify the most likely
outcomes or as a probabilistic map of the solution landscape.

Quantum annealer dynamics are dominated by paths through the mean field energy
landscape that have the highest transition probabilities. Figure 1 shows a
path that connects local minimum A to local minimum D.

Figure 2 shows the effect of quantum tunneling (in blue) to reduce the thermal
activation energy needed to overcome the barriers between the local minima
with the greatest advantage observed from A to B and B to C, and a negligible
gain from C to D. The principle and benefits are explained in detail in the
paper “What is the Computational Value of Finite Range Tunneling?”

**The D-Wave 2X: Interstellar Overdrive – How cool is that?**

As a research area, quantum computing is highly competitive, but if you want
to buy a quantum computer then D-Wave Systems, founded in 1999, is the only
game in town. Quantum computing is as promising as it is unproven. Quantum
computing goes beyond Moore’s law since every quantum bit (qubit) doubles the
computational power, similar to the famous wheat and chessboard problem. So
the payoff is huge, even though it is expensive, unproven, and difficult to
program.

The advantage of quantum annealing machines is they are much simpler to build
than gate-model quantum computing machines. The latest D-Wave machine (the
D-Wave 2X), installed at NASA Ames, is approximately twice as powerful as the
previous model at over 1,000 qubits (1,097). This compares with roughly 10
cubits for current gate-model quantum systems, so two orders of magnitude.
It’s a question of scale, no simple task, and a unique achievement. Although
quantum researchers initially questioned whether the D-Wave system even
qualified as a quantum computer, albeit a subset of quantum computing
architectures, that argument seems mostly settled and it is now generally
accepted that quantum characteristics have been adequately demonstrated.

In a D-Wave system, a coupled pair of qubits (quantum bits) demonstrate
quantum entanglement (they influence each other), so that the entangled pair
can be in any one of four states resulting from how the coupling and energy
biases are programmed. By representing the problem to be addressed as an
energy map the most likely outcomes can be derived by identifying the lowest
energy states.

A lattice of approximately 1,000 tiny superconducting circuits (the qubits) is
chilled close to absolute zero to deliver quantum effects. A user models a
problem into a search for the lowest point in a vast energy landscape. The
processor considers all possibilities simultaneously to determine the lowest
energy required to form those relationships. Multiple solutions are returned
to the user, scaled to show optimal answers, in an execution time of around 20
microseconds, practically instantaneously for all intents and purposes.

The D-wave system cabinet – “The Fridge”– is a closed cycle dilution
refrigerator. The superconducting processor itself generates no heat, but to
operate reliably must be cooled to about 180 times colder than interstellar
space, approximately 0.015° Kelvin.

**Environmental considerations: Green is the color**

To function reliably, quantum computing systems require environments that are
not only shielded from the Earth’s natural environment, but would be
considered inhospitable to any known life form. A high vacuum is required, a
pressure 10 billion times lower than atmospheric pressure, and shielded to
50,000 times less than Earth’s magnetic field. Not exactly a normal office,
datacenter, or HPC facility environment.

On the other hand, the self-contained “Fridge" and servers consume just 25kW
of power (approximately the power draw of a single heavily populated standard
rack) and about three orders of magnitude (1000 times) less power than the
current number one system on the TOP500, including its cooling system. Perhaps
a more significant consideration is that power demand is not anticipated to
increase significantly as it scales to several thousands of qubits and beyond.

In addition to doubling the number of qubits compared with the prior D-Wave
system, the D-Wave 2X delivers lower noise in qubits and couples, delivering
greater confidence in achieved results.

**So much for the pictures, what about the conversations?**

Now that we have largely moved beyond the debate of whether a D-Wave system is
actually a quantum machine or not, then the question “OK, so what now?” could
bring us back to chasing rabbits, although this time inspired by the classic
Jefferson Airplane song, “White Rabbit”:

“One algorithm makes you larger  
And another makes you small  
But do the ones a D-Wave processes  
Do anything at all?”

That of course, is where the conversations begin. It may depend upon the
definition of “useful” and also a comparison between “conventional” systems
and quantum computing approaches. Even the fastest supercomputer we can build
using the most advanced traditional technologies can still only perform
analysis by examining each possible solution serially, one solution at a time.
This makes optimizing complex problems with a large number of variables and
large data sets a very time consuming business. By comparison, once a problem
has been suitably constructed for a quantum computer it can explore all the
possible solutions at once and instantly identify the most likely outcomes.

If we consider relative performance then we begin to have a simplistic basis
for comparison, at least for execution times. The QuAIL system was benchmarked
for the time required to find the optimal solution with 99% probability for
different problem sizes up to 945 variables. Simulated Annealing (SA), Quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC) and the D-Wave 2X were compared. Full details are available
in the paper referenced previously. Shown in the chart are the 50th, 75th and
85th percentiles over a set of 100 instances. The error bars represent 95%
confidence intervals from bootstrapping.

This experiment occupied millions of processor cores for several days to tune
and run the classical algorithms for these benchmarks. The runtimes for the
higher quantiles for the larger problem sizes for QMC were not computed
because the computational cost was too high.  

The results demonstrate a performance advantage to the quantum annealing
approach by a factor of 100 million compared with simulated annealing running
on a single state of the art processor core. By comparison the current leading
system on the TOP500 has fewer than 6 million cores of any kind, implying a
clear performance advantage for quantum annealing based on execution time.

The challenge and the next step is to explore the mapping of real world
problems to quantum machines and to improve the programming environments,
which will no doubt take a significant amount of work and many conversations.
New players will become more visible, early use cases and gaps will become
better defined, new use cases will be identified, and a short stack will
emerge to ease programming. This is reminiscent of the early days of computing
or space flight.

**A quantum of solace for the TOP500: Size still matters.**

Even though we don’t expect to see viable exascale systems this decade, and
quite likely not before the middle of the next, we won’t be seeing a
Quantum500 anytime soon either. NASA talks about putting humans on Mars
sometime in the 2030s and it isn’t unrealistic to think about practical
quantum computing as being on a similar trajectory. Recent research at the
University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sidney, Australia demonstrated that it
may be possible to create quantum computer chips that could store thousands,
even millions of qubits on a single silicon processor chip leveraging
conventional computer technology.

Although the current D-Wave 2X system is a singular achievement it is still
regarded as being relatively small to handle real world problems, and would
benefit from getting beyond pairwise connectivity, but that isn’t really the
point.  It plays a significant role in research into areas such as vision
systems, artificial intelligence and machine learning alongside its
optimization capabilities.

In the near term, we’ve got enough information and evidence to get the
picture. It will be the conversations that become paramount with both
conventional and quantum computing systems working together to develop better
algorithms and expand the boundaries of knowledge and achievement.
