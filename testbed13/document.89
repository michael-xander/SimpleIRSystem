# IBM puts quantum computer on-line

IBM has made a quantum computer available on the internet for anyone to run
algorithms on.

Called IBM Quantum Experience, the five qubit machine is on a single cryogenic
chip at the TJ Watson Research Center in New York.

“This moment represents the birth of quantum cloud computing. By giving hands-
on access to IBM’s experimental quantum systems, the IBM Quantum Experience
will make it easier for researchers and the scientific community to accelerate
innovations in the quantum field, and help discover new applications for this
technology,” said IBM Research director Arvind Krishna.

Quantum computers have similarities to digital computers, but are different
beast, with enormous capability - if ways can be found to create the necessary
delicate quantum states, and sustain them long enough for them to produce a
result.

“IBM envisions medium-sized quantum processors of 50-100 qubits to be possible
in the next decade,” said IBM. “None of today’s TOP500 supercomputers could
successfully emulate a quantum computer built of 50 qubits, reflecting the
tremendous potential of this technology.”

Standard digital algorithms are not applicable to quantum computing, and a
large amount of work on suitable algorithms has already been done. “The
community of quantum computer scientists and theorists is working to harness
the power," said IBM. "Applications in optimisation and chemistry will likely
be the first to demonstrate quantum speed-up.”

Last year, IBM found a way to detect quantum errors by combining
superconducting qubits in a lattice “whose quantum circuit design is the only
physical architecture that can scale to larger dimensions”, claimed the firm.

In superconducting metal on a silicon chip, its team has now combined five
qubits in the lattice architecture, “which demonstrates 'parity measurement',
the basis of many quantum error correction protocols”, said IBM. “The road
towards universal quantum computing hinges upon the achievement of quantum
error correction.”

“Access to early quantum computing prototypes will be key in imagining and
developing future applications,” said Dario Gil, v-p of science at IBM
Research. “If you want to understand what a true quantum computer will do for
you and how it works, this is the place to do it. You won’t experience it
anywhere else.”

The quantum computer platform is an initiative within the IBM Research
Frontiers Institute, a recently-formed consortium with members including
Samsung, JSR, and Honda in wnich organisations can make use of IBM’s
researchers and facilities.

Training materials and simulations are available alongside the computer.
