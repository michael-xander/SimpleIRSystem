If you hear in the news that someone's built a quantum computer you better
block your credit card quick. All the methods that are used to encrypt your
card details when you buy something online could be cracked by such a computer
within seconds. And it's not only your bank details — classified information
from all sources would become transparent instantly.

Many sensational claims have been made about quantum computers, but this one
is true. Current encryption methods use mathematical problems that nobody
knows how to crack on an ordinary computer, but which can easily be dealt with
using a quantum computer. What else can we say about the power of quantum
computers, compared to ordinary ones?

### Cracking codes

Internet security relies on mathematical problems that are hard to solve.

A lot of theoretical effort has gone into answering this question, but it's
tricky territory. RSA cryptography, a method used widely to keep our data
safe, hinges on the fact that it's hard to factor large numbers (see here to
find out how). If I give you the number 10, you'll be able to tell me
instantly that its factors are 2 and 5. If I give you something like
62,615,533, however, your mental arithmetic will fail you.

And it's not just your mental arithmetic. Once the number to be factored is
large enough, computers struggle too. "Given a number with, say, 4000 digits,
all the computers in the world running for the age of the Universe will hardly
get started [on factoring it]," says Richard Jozsa, a pioneer of quantum
computing at the University of Cambridge.

Many other problems suffer from the same ailment as number factoring: we may
have an algorithm for solving them, but the number of steps the algorithm
needs to execute grows as the input to the problem becomes larger. Another
example is the famous _travelling salesman problem_, which involves finding
the shortest route that visits each of a number of cities exactly once: the
more cities there are, the greater the headache.

Complexity theorists classify problems according to this growth in the number
of steps (or, equivalently, the time) needed to solve them. If the growth is
exponential, as is believed to be the case for the travelling salesman
problem, then that’s obviously bad: exponential growth is explosive. Problems
are deemed to be do-able when the number of steps needed grows like a
_polynomial_ in the size of the input: if the size of the input is  then the
number of steps needed grows in proportion to  or  or  for some other natural
number  That growth can still be pretty fast (consider ), but complexity
theorists deem it tame. "Polynomial time is a mathematical model for feasible
computing," explains Jozsa. "If it doesn’t run in polynomial time, we think of
it as uncomputable in practice."

Number factoring is believed to be uncomputable in this sense: nobody knows a
polynomial-time algorithm that would run on the kind of computers we have
today. This is where quantum computing triumphs. In 1994 the mathematician
Peter Shor came up with a quantum algorithm that would run, not only in
polynomial time, but in relatively fast polynomial time, involving an exponent
as small as 3. The algorithm uses the maths of number theory to turn the
factoring problem into one of recognising periodic patterns within certain
mathematical functions — and pattern recognition is what quantum computers are
good at.

Something similar goes for all other cryptography methods in use today,
including, for example, elliptic curve cryptography: quantum computers can
crack them with ease.

That looks good for quantum computing, but in this field few things are
certain. "In complexity theory it's notoriously difficult to prove that a
given task _cannot_ be solved in polynomial time," says Jozsa. "That's an
embarrassing fact." Only because nobody knows of a polynomial-time algorithm
for number factoring, this doesn't mean that there isn't one, waiting to be
discovered. "It's not at all out of the question that some bright number
theorist will come along next week and do it," says Jozsa. "That will be a bit
of a dampener for quantum computing."

### Complex complexity

But what about other problems? Can quantum computing outstrip classical
computing on problems that are verifiably harder than number factoring? To
answer this question we first need to know what we mean by "harder", which
brings us to the hierarchy of complexity classes mathematicians have come up
with. First there are the "easy" problems, those for which we have polynomial-
time algorithms (for ordinary computers), which together form a class called
_P_. Then there is a class of problems for which we don't have a polynomial-
time algorithm, but for which we can easily check (in polynomial time) whether
a proposed solution is correct. That class is called _NP_. Number factoring is
part of the NP class. While factoring a large number is very time-consuming,
multiplying two supposed factors of a number to check whether they really are
factors is comparatively quick. The difference arises because multiplying two
numbers involves one "act of multiplication", while factoring might require
lots and lots of trial divisions.

Within the NP class, there are problems that are thought to be particularly
difficult — these are called _NP-complete_. (The travelling salesman problem
is an example.) Above the NP-complete problems there are many more complexity
classes which we won't even mention here.

Number factoring is definitely in the NP class, but people don't believe it's
in the NP-complete class. Since quantum computing can beat classical computing
on number factoring, the next question is what happens when we go up a step in
the hierarchy, to NP-complete problems. One of the sensational claims that is
sometimes made about quantum computing is that it can solve these exceedingly
hard NP-complete problems in the blink of an eye. But that claim is over-
ambitious. "We don't know if we can solve an NP complete problem with quantum
computing — in fact, we don't think we can," explains Jozsa.

At this point we should acknowledge the central burning issue of complexity
theory: that none of this can be proven. Not only do we not know whether
quantum computers can solve NP complete problems efficiently, we don't even
know that ordinary computers _can't_ solve them efficiently. Just as there may
be a polynomial-time algorithm to factor numbers which hasn't been discovered
yet, so there may also be polynomial-time algorithms for other NP problems,
including NP complete ones. If there are, then our hierarchy of classes
collapses: the P class, the NP class and the NP complete class turn out to be
one and the same. If you can prove or disprove that P equals NP, you will win
yourself a million dollars from the Clay Mathematics Institute: it's deemed
one of the seven most intriguing open questions in maths.

### So what _will_ quantum computers do?

If the theory leaves us on shaky ground, what can we say about practical uses
of quantum computing? Problems in the _P_ class might be "easy" in a
theoretical sense, but they can still take a very long time to solve. Can
quantum computing help here?

The answer is yes. An example is a "needle-in-a-haystack" problem that
involves searching large and unordered data bases for a particular piece of
information. Imagine, for example, searching a telephone book with  entries,
not for a particular person, but for a particular phone number. It’s a time
consuming task because unlike the names in the book, which are ordered
alphabetically, the numbers come in no particular order. A classical computer
has no choice but to look at the entries one by one, so in the worst case,
when the number it is looking for doesn’t exist or is the last entry, it’ll
need  operations. A quantum computer can perform the task using only
operations. This might not seem like a huge speed-up, but when  is large it
can be considerable: if  for example, we are talking a thousand operations on
a quantum computer versus a million on an ordinary one.

Molecules are made up of many particles that are all subject to the laws of
quantum mechanics.

Another very exciting application of quantum computing will be in chemistry,
biology and medicine. If you are trying to understand a molecular system, for
example in order to design a new drug, it's a good idea to simulate its
behaviour on a computer. The trouble is that molecules are made up of many
particles that are all subject to the laws of quantum mechanics. As we
mentioned in a previous article, the information needed to describe the
quantum state of a system of many parts grows exponentially with the number of
parts, making calculations hard. "It's exponentially complicated," says Jozsa.
"It turns out that even for relatively small molecules, the best classical
computers are still too weak to simulate the quantum dynamics, whereas on a
quantum computer we [could do it]."

Cryptography would also benefit from quantum computers. For example, since a
quantum state changes when it is observed, it is possible to design ways of
ascertaining whether a person has eavesdropped on a message. Using that method
people can send each other _encryption keys_ — strings of symbols that are
used to encrypt and decrypt messages — and be sure they'll be alerted straight
away if someone has intercepted the key. "Actual devices for doing this exist
because they require no more than a few [qubits], and therefore are within the
scope of current quantum technology" says Jozsa. The method was first put in
public practice all the way back in 2007 when it was used to secure the
transfer of votes in an election in Geneva, Switzerland. However little we
might be able to say about the advantages of quantum computing from a
theoretical stand point, at least we know there's some compensation for
devastating our encryption methods.
