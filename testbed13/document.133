A team of international scientists from Canada, the U.K., Germany, the
Netherlands and Sweden announced Friday that they had developed a model
biological supercomputer capable of solving complex mathematical problems
using far less energy than standard electronic supercomputers. The model
“biocomputer,” which is roughly the size of a book, is powered by Adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) — dubbed the “molecular unit of currency.”

According to description of the device, published in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, the biocomputer uses proteins present in all
living cells to function. It uses a strategy similar to that of quantum
computers, which use qubits — the quantum computing equivalents of bits — to
perform “parallel computation,” wherein  computers are able to process
information quickly and accurately by performing several calculations
simultaneously, rather than sequentially.

In the case of the biocomputer, the qubits are replaced with short strings of
proteins — powered by ATP — working in parallel. As the researchers involved
in the study explain, the circuit of the biocomputer “looks a bit like a road
map of a busy and very organized city as seen from a plane.”

“In simple terms, it involves the building of a labyrinth of nano-based
channels that have specific traffic regulations for protein filaments. The
solution in the labyrinth corresponds to the answer of a mathematical
question, and many molecules can find their way through the labyrinth at the
same time,” Heiner Linke, director of nanoscience at Lund University in
Sweden, said in a statement. “The fact that molecules are very cheap and that
we have now shown the biocomputer’s calculations work leads me to believe that
biocomputers have the prerequisites for practical use within ten years.”

According to the researchers, the biocomputer would require less than one
percent of the energy consumed by an electronic transistor, making them much
more sustainable than electronic supercomputers, which often require their own
power plant to function.

“It’s hard to say how soon it will be before we see a full scale bio super-
computer. One option for dealing with larger and more complex problems may be
to combine our device with a conventional computer to form a hybrid device,”
Dan Nicolau from the department of bioengineering at Canada’s McGill
University said in a statement. “Right now we’re working on a variety of ways
to push the research further.”
