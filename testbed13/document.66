# The quantum computer that could 'spell the end of encryption': Device uses
lasers on atoms to quickly crack 'impossible' codes

  * **Scientists have developed a computer which could crack current security **
  * **It uses quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once**
  * **They used an ion trap to create the quantum computer from just five atoms**
  * **The device could pave the way for larger scale quantum computers capable of more superior encryption methods than currently used******

Encryption underpins the security of bank cards, state secrets and online
privacy.

By using large sets of numbers, the process of encoding information means that
only the person, or computer, with the key can decode it.

But this could be put to the test after scientists developed the first five-
atom quantum computer with the potential to crack the security of traditional
encryption schemes.

The researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Austria's
University of Innsbruck call it 'the beginning of the end for encryption
schemes'.

Most encryption used today uses integer factorisation, or 'the factoring
problem', and its security comes from the difficulty of factoring large
numbers.

For example, finding the prime factors, or multipliers, for the number 15 is
fairly easy as it's a small number.

However, a larger number such as 91, may take some pen and paper.

An even larger number, say with 232 digits, has taken scientists two years to
factor, using hundreds of classical computers operating in parallel.

Qubits can exist in three states at once rather than the binary 1 or 0 of
conventional bits - 'up', 'down' and in a 'superposition' of both. This means
that, unlike standard computers, quantum computers can perform multiple
calculations in parallel and hold far more information than normal bits

In encryption, two different, but intimately related numbers, are used for the
encryption and decryption, making it easy to calculate but hard to reverse.

###  QUANTUM ENCRYPTION

In computer encryption, two related numbers are used for the encryption and
decryption, making it easy to calculate but hard to reverse.

But quantum computers are expected to outperform traditional computers and
crack this problem by using hundreds of atoms, essentially in parallel, to
quickly factor huge numbers because data is encoded in the 'spin' of
individual electrons.

Unlike standard computers, quantum bits, or qubits can exist in multiple
states at once rather than the binary 1 or 0 of conventional bits.

This means they can perform multiple calculations in parallel and hold far
more information than normal bits.

However, a quantum computer is expected to outperform traditional computers

Unlike standard computers, quantum bits, or qubits can exist in multiple
states at once rather than the binary 1 or 0 of conventional bits.

This means they can perform multiple calculations in parallel and hold far
more information than normal bits.

For example, a computer with just 1,000 qubits could easily crack modern
encryption keys while smartphone games like Angry Birds typically use 40,000
conventional bits to run.

It typically takes about 12 qubits to factor the number 15, but researchers at
MIT and the University of Innsbruck in Austria have found a way to pare that
down to five qubits, each represented by a single atom.

This has been designed and built by a quantum computer from five atoms in an
ion trap.

Encryption is used to protect sensitive information on as it is transferred
from computer to computer, such as for internet banking (stock image). But
quantum computing looks set to shake things up. The current computer uses
laser pulses to carry out algorithms on each atom, to correctly factor the
number 15

The computer uses laser pulses to carry out algorithms on each atom, to
correctly factor the number 15.

'The approach thus provides the potential for designing a powerful quantum
computer, but with fewer resources,' said the research paper.

### QUANTUM COMPUTER ON A CHIP

In a 'triumph of electrical engineering,' a team of Australian engineers
recently squashed any doubts about the forthcoming reality of quantum
computers, finding answers to a phenomenon that even perplexed Einstein.

The engineers from Australia's University of New South Wales (UNSW) proved
that quantum computer code can be written and manipulated using two quantum
bits in a silicon microchip - and they proved it with the highest score ever
achieved.

The breakthrough could pave the way for the first commercial manufacture of
the 'holy grail' of superfast computing.

'We factor the number 15 by effectively employing and controlling seven qubits
and four 'cache qubits' and by implementing generalised arithmetic operations,
known as modular multipliers.'

The system is designed in a way that more atoms and lasers can be added to
build a bigger and faster quantum computer, able to factor much larger
numbers.

The scientists said the results represent the first scalable implementation of
Shor's algorithm, a quantum algorithm named after mathematician Peter Shor in
1994 to solve the factorisation problem.

'We show that Shor's algorithm, the most complex quantum algorithm known to
date, is realisable in a way where, yes, all you have to do is go in the lab,
apply more technology, and you should be able to make a bigger quantum
computer,' said Isaac Chuang, professor of physics and professor of electrical
engineering and computer science at MIT.

'It might still cost an enormous amount of money to build - you won't be
building a quantum computer and putting it on your desktop anytime soon - but
now it's much more an engineering effort, and not a basic physics question.'

The researchers claimed the ion-trap quantum computer returns the correct
factors with a confidence level exceeding 99 per cent.
