# Quantum Computer May Crack Public-Key Encryption

RSA encryption not immune

LAKE WALES, Fla.--No shortage of encryption and decryption schemes exists, but
for those schemes that merely depend on the difficulty of finding the factors
of two large prime numbers multiplied together, their days may be numbered,
according to a team of researchers.

Known as public-key encryption, this encryption method--the most notable
example being the popular Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) scheme --appears to be
doomed by quantum computing, according to Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT, Cambridge) theorists working with prototyping experts at the
University of Innsbruck (Austria). Using an algorithm invented by MIT
professor Peter Shor and made scalable by Professor Alexei Kitaev at the
California Institute of Technology (CalTech, Pasadena), a quantum computer was
built to prove the concept, as presented in the paper Realization of a
Scalable Shor Algorithm.

encryption sizes, such as 128- or 256-bits.

RSA algorithms use a public key to encrypt messages, but require a private key
(usually the product of two large prime numbers) to decrypt them. RSA is often
beefed up by "padding"--adding nonsense phrases at the beginning of an
encrypted message (such as its most famous example, the world wonders)--or
"hashing"--a function that maps data of variable lengths to data of fixed
lengths. However, the leader of the project at MIT--professor Isaac Chuang--
believes that even padding and hashing added to public-key-encryption can be
cracked by future quantum computers with a little extra work.

"Shor's quantum factoring algorithm would probably help with breaking schemes
which employ padding and hashing, but it would not suffice by itself," Chuang
told EE Times in an exclusive interview.

**[ Understanding the IoT Platform Wars: Technical Trade Offs at ESC Boston]**

Chuang, in fact, warns countries to use a different encryption scheme
altogether to hide state secrets today, because when quantum computers become
common in the future, it will be possible to uncover old state secrets that
could still harm the national security of a sovereign state.

On the other hand, when quantum computers do become common, it will be
possible to use quantum cryptography methods to produce uncrackable codes--
even by others who have quantum computers.

"Quantum cryptography is a well-known scheme, which is uncrackable, as long as
the laws of quantum physics are correct, as known today," Chuang told EE
Times.

Only the 3 and 5 results from the quantum computer match on the truth table by
both existing on the intersecting factor lines.  
(Source: MIT)

Even making Shor's initial algorithm into a bullet-proof executable that could
be extended to any length decryption key was a feat many years in the making,
since Shor's original "thought experiment" was presented back in 1994. Even so
it will be many many years before this proof-of-concept quantum computer can
be extended to a size to solve today's modern 128- and 256-bit codes.

Based on the University of Innsbruck prototype using Kitaev's approach that
required 5-qubits (super cooled atoms in traps controlled by lasers) the MIT
design was thus able to shave 6-qubits off the typical Shor-algorithm (that
requires 7-qubits plus 4-qubits as a "cache"). Still, the biggest problem it
could solve was the simplest of all factors of two prime numbers, namely 3 and
5 (the two smallest prime numbers) as the factors of 15 (with a confidence of
99 percent, unlike any high-school student who can solve the problem with 100
percent confidence). The importance of the scheme, however, is its scalability
that can theoretically someday tackle the 128- and 256-bit codes used by RSA.

Chuang and colleagues admit that it would be prohibitively expensive today to
use conventional components--super cooled atoms and lasers--to scale up to RSA
sizes, but the point is that someday when tiny solid-state quantum computers
are in general use they will be able to use this algorithm to crack today's
commonly used codes--as well as to produce uncrackable codes using new
quantum-mechanical methods.

Funding was supplied by the Intelligence Advanced Research Project Activity
(IARPA), and the MIT-Harvard Center for Ultracold Atoms, a National Science
Foundation Physics Frontier Center.

_Article update: The headline now reads "Quantum Computer May Crack Public-Key
Encryption" rather than the original title ("Quantum Computers Crack Public-
Key Encryption"), which suggests more than one quantum computer and current
widespread use. The article is about only one experimental quantum computer
that was specifically built to prove a quantum computer could break public-key
encryption._

Yes, as wave.forest notes, Shor'e quantum formula does crack EEC and more
easily than RSA since EEC uses 372- bit security, whereas Monern RSA uses 1024
to 3073.

@traneus, you raise a good and simple point that is often overlooked about
quantum computing, which is this: The parallel processing of a "superposition
of states" that is a major part (but not the only part) of why quantum
computing is so fast is in fact pretty much the same thing as what used to be
called analog computing. An analog wave form is after all just a superposition
of an infinite number of sinusoidal states, so processing that wave in clever
ways allows processing power from all of those states at the same time.  
  
In quantum computing those sinusoidals are the different momentum states of
the electrons, allowing you in effect to process at one time an "infinite"
range of unique electron momentum states in the same circuit, at the same
time. (I should note that there is also a more exotic, more powerful, and
completely non-classical aspect of quantum computing that involves time. That
part of QC cannot be replicated by any type of classical system, pretty much
by definition, since only quantum systems can in certain ways be indifferent
to the flow of classical time.)  
  
In the old days, pretty much the same idea of processing many electrons states
at once was implmented much more robustly by having populations of electrons
form classical (vs the much more delicate quantum) wave forms. We called those
systems analog computers, and when set up properly they could converge with
truly amazing speed to an approxmate result.  
  
And that also is the rub: "approximate" doesn't work when you are trying to
factor a very larger number. It has to be exact!  
  
However, there are ways to be clever about all of this by dividing up the
problem in ways where you use multiple approximations to build collectively
build towards a single well-defined solution. So the problem you raise is very
much valid, but not necessarily insurmountable. After all, even we humans with
our slow, rather bizarre, and fully classical mix of analog and digital (yes,
digital: we use pulse coding to preserve signal levels as they are transmitted
along nerves) signal processing are capable at times of exquisite levels of
precision through a combination of approximation and feedback that lets us
converge to feats such as a precisely thrown major-league baseball. There is
no fundamental reason why the larger tool set of quantum computing cannot be
also be configured so that despite the approximations and limits on resolution
at individual stages of processing, the final result can be very precise
indeed.

@ R_Colin_Johnson  
  
The Shor's algorithm works for ECC as well.  
  
Neither RSA nor ECC is secure under quantum computing. We all know it is
coming. The question is "When?"  
  
Your article is very good to raise the awareness.  
  
On the other hand, the "May" in "Quantum Computer May Crack Public-Key
Encryption" is not accurate either (LOL). It is not "May" - it is "Will". Your
articles shows the advance. This advance is well accepted and this is why we
are on post-quantum cryptography.  
  
But, please forgive my picky-ness. Thank you for this very good article.

@ Colin  
  
You are ABSOLUTELY right. We should not sleep, but see the consequences when
all our RSA secrets are on the streets in -perhaps- a couple of years from
now. From government point of view this is a no-brainer: They certainly will
invest in QC, depending of the regime you are living in -of course. Even for
governmental critical communication: They should consider this fact too.

You may be right there too, but the quantum computer makers claim its only a
matter of time :)

Quantum computers are analog computers, so are sensitive to noise. I expect
that scaling up will turn out to be more difficult than expected.

Yes, I think you are right--ECC is definately what those who want their
secrets to stay secret should use. I'm not sure if there is a theoretical
quantum algorithm for breaking ECC, but there may be. If there is, that would
seem to be MIT's obvious next step. Let me contact them and get back to you.
Thanks for sharing your expertise in RSA and ECC.

256-bit RSA does not need quantum computer

Where is the disconnect; As far as I know solving 128bit RSA is done in a few
seconds on a standard PC. Seems 512bit RSA is cracked in hours these days.
Furthermore, RSA key lenght for secure encryption went from 1024 bits to 2048
bits some time ago and 3072bits is next - if RSA is used at all. Elliptic
Curve Cryptpgtraphy is more popular. For ECC 256 bits are still considered OK,
but 384 bits is next. I don't think MIT is confued about the difference
between RSA and ECC? Can we have an update of this article that clarifies?

You guys are all missing the point--MIT has cracked RSA and shown the proof of
concept for 4-bits. Before this we all "knew"--meaning accepted the
speculation--that quantum computers would eventually crack the prime-factor
algorithm, but MIT has done it, and shown you step-by-step how to build a
quantum computer to do it for any sized key. Yes, its prohibitively expensive
now, but D-Wave and a new wave of companies (and nation states) now have
explicit instructions on how to build an RSA cracker. Before it seemed to just
be a matter of time, but now its proven! The code is cracked now--its just up
to you to expand it from 4- to 128-bits using Shor's algorithm as extended by
Kitaev. Don't use RSA if you never want your secrets revealed.

Of course this is a significant advance, but it is well accepted that quantum
computing is coming and will break RSA and ECC. The problem is money and time.
So there are post-quantum crypto research.  
  
The title is misleading. ;)
