The Internet was abuzz with praise for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
on Saturday after clips showing him schooling a reporter on quantum computing
went viral.

While political opponents learned a lesson about underestimating the
photogenic Trudeau, 44, during last year’s surprise electoral upset, the
unnamed reporter fell into the same trap during an event at a Canadian
university on Friday when he jokingly tested the former teacher's knowledge.

Trudeau’s explanation on quantum computing generated cheers and applause from
the room and set social media abuzz.

The exchange began when the reporter told Trudeau:

“Morning, sir, I was going to ask you to explain quantum computing, but — when
do you expect Canada's ISIL mission to begin again, and are we not doing
anything in the interim?"

Trudeau immediately shot back with an explanation on quantum computers,
explaining how they do not operate on the principles of conventional physics
and are more powerful than current mainstream computers.

"Don't get me going on this, or we'll be here all day, trust me," he added.

“I wish there were more like him,” said a Twitter user with the handle
@tonticologo.

Trudeau addressed Canada’s actions against the Islamic State militants
directly afterward, although he did not announce any new measures.

The son of a former prime minister, Trudeau led his center-left Liberals to a
majority victory in last year’s election with a campaign that emphasised hope
and optimism.

His political opponents had attacked him as “just not ready” for the job,
implying his best feature was his hair rather than his intellectual prowess.
