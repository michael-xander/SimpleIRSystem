Justin Trudeau can do no wrong, so when the Canadian PM gave an impromptu
explanation of the rather complex field of quantum computing, we were all very
impressed.

Well, not all of us.

Sure, Trudeau can do a one-armed push up to impress any veteran, or pull a
desk handstand to win over any yogi, but what does an experimental quantum
physics expert think of his explanation of quantum computing?

We asked The University Of Sydney's experimental physicist David Reilly, who
spends his days pondering quantum nanoscience in the Quantum Nanoscience
Laboratory in the School of Physics.

"I think he does a really good job," Reilly said.

"He starts to get a little bit off the track there in the details of quantum
but I think he does a fantastic job and it's really great to see a politician
have some knowledge of the field."

Watch the above video for his full assessment, but the overall score is "A+
for effort".
