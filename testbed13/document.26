This is the last post in the series on myths about quantum computing.

One of the most exciting things about quantum information is quantum
teleportation--the ability to transmit quantum data by sending only classical
bits. Superdense coding is another surprising protocol which lets you transmit
two classical bits by sending only one qubit.

It is often mistakenly believed that these two features of quantum information
do not have a classical equivalent. The goal of this post is to explain why
this is not the case, and to clarify other related misconceptions.

**Bell states**

Let us first briefly discuss some simple facts that are useful for explaining
how quantum teleportation works. Let . Then the following four two-qubit
states are orthonormal and form a basis:

This is known as Bell basis. One can prepare  from the standard basis state
as follows:

One of the most important properties of Bell states is that any Bell state can
be mapped to any other by applying local Pauli matrices on only one of the
systems:

**Quantum teleportation**

The setting for quantum teleportation is as follows. Assume that Alice has a
single-qubit quantum state  that she wants to send to Bob. Moreover, they have
met beforehand and established a joint two-qubit quantum state

known as EPR pair, shared between them. Here is a schematic diagram of how
quantum teleportation works:

Here "Bell" denotes the measurement in the Bell basis whose outcomes are
classical bits _z_ and _x_, and  is the correction operator that Bob has to
apply to recover the original state.

Quantum teleportation works because of the following identity:

which holds for any single qubit state . From this identity we see that when
Alice performs the Bell measurement, she gets two uniformly random bits _z_
and _x_, and Bob's state collapses to  which is a distorted version of . Once
Bob receives _z_ and _x_, he can apply  to recover . Note that an adversary
who intercepts _z_ and _x_ cannot learn anything about , since both bits are
uniformly random.

The usual argument why quantum teleportation is surprising, is that it allows
to transmit a quantum state  with two continuous degrees of freedom (say, the
angles in the Bloch sphere) by sending only two classical bits. This may seem
quite paradoxical, since it appears as if two real numbers have been
transmitted by sending just two bits. However, this is not the case at all,
since the two parameters describing  cannot be recovered (to any reasonable
degree of precision) from a single copy of . For example, we know by Holevo's
theorem that one cannot learn more than one bit of information by measuring .

**Classical teleportation**

What is the classical equivalent of the above procedure? Let us first set up
some terminology and notation. Since we will be dealing with probability
distributions, let

denote the uniform distribution over {0,1}. Similarly, let

be the classical version of the EPR state .

Intuitively, one should think of probability distributions as a way of
describing a coin that has been flipped and (without looking at it) put inside
a sealed envelope. Note that one can perform operations on such coin, even
though its exact state is not known. For example, by flipping the envelope
around one can perform the logical NOT. One could also imagine some more
complicated procedures for performing joint operations on two coins in a joint
unknown state.

We will use the term **_pbit_** to refer to a _probabilistic bit_ that
describes a coin inside the envelope. Note that a pbit has one degree of
freedom. However, once the envelope has been opened, the state of the coin
becomes certain, i.e., either [0] or [1], so we will describe it by a
_deterministic bit_ or **_dbit_**. Note that this is analogous to how
measurements work in the quantum case, except that in the classical case there
is only one measurement basis--the standard basis.

Now we are ready to describe the classical teleportation. Our task is the
following: we would like to transmit one pbit by sending one dbit. In other
words, we want to transmit one degree of freedom per one classical bit being
sent, just as in the quantum case.

At first, this might seem trivial--can't we just send the bit over and be
done? Unfortunately, not. Recall that we want to transmit a pbit or an
"unobserved coin", but we are allowed to send only a dbit. In other words,
your envelope will always be opened and its content revealed, just as if you
were a journalist sending an e-mail from China. Let us depict this situation
with the following diagram:

Here the dark pipe represents a pbit in state , but the white pipe a dbit
obtained by observing . The dashed line between Alice and Bob represents
Chinese government.

To make this scheme work, we will use a shared resource between Alice and Bob
as in the quantum case. A natural classical equivalent of the EPR state  is
the probability distribution  defined above. To preserve our pbit , we will
XOR it with Alice's half of , and send the result over to Bob. Even though the
pbit  is turned into a dbit due to Chinese government spying on Alice, Bob can
still XOR it with his half of  and recover the original pbit :

This indeed gives the correct result, since the original pbit essentially gets
XORed with the same value twice. Intuitively, one can think of it being
transmitted "back in time" through the black pipe that represents . Just as in
the quantum case, the party who intercepts the transmitted bit learns nothing
about , since the transmitted bit is uniformly random. In fact, this scheme is
equivalent to one-time pad.

**Quantum superdense coding**

Quantum superdense coding is the dual protocol of quantum teleportation (this
can be made more precise by considering coherent communication). It allows to
send two classical bits by transmitting a single qubit and consuming one
shared EPR pair.

Initially Alice and Bob share an EPR state . Alice encodes her two classical
bits _z_ and _x_ in her half of  by performing . This maps the joint state of
Alice and Bob to Bell state  as discussed above. Then Alice sends her qubit
over to Bob, who can recover both bits by performing a measurement in the Bell
basis:

Quantum superdense coding works because of the following identity:

This immediately follows from the properties of Bell states discussed above.
Since all Bell states are maximally entangled, their reduced states are
completely mixed, so the transmitted qubit contains no information about the
two encoded classical bits _z_ and _x_.

**Classical "supersparse" coding**

Classical superdense coding is very similar to classical teleportation, except
the roles of dbit and pbit are reversed, i.e., Alice wants to transmit a dbit
by sending a pbit. This seems to be even simpler than teleportation, since we
are given more resources and asked to perform a simpler task! In fact, there
is nothing "superdense" about this task, as it only wastes resources. In this
sense it would be more appropriate to call it "supersparse" coding!

The only catch is that for complete analogy with the quantum case, the
transmitted pbit should be uniformly random, so that a potential eavesdropper
could learn nothing about the original message. Here is a protocol that
achieves the task of transmitting a dbit _b_ in the desired way:

Note that the only difference between this picture and the one for classical
teleportation is the color of pipes.

**Conclusion**

Quantum teleportation should not seem more surprising than the classical one,
since in both cases one degree of freedom is transmitted per one classical bit
being sent. The only quantitative difference is a factor of two in the amount
of resources consumed: one ebit is consumed for sending two degrees of freedom
in the quantum case versus one shared random bit per single degree of freedom
in the classical case. Recall that we observed the same factor-of-two
difference in the case of the amount of information needed to specify a
quantum versus a classical probabilistic state within the exponential state
space.

Thus, given the existence of a classical equivalent, quantum teleportation
should not seem too surprising. At least, no more than by a factor of two!

p.s. As Matthew Leifer has pointed out to me, these and many other analogies
between quantum entanglement and secret classical correlations have been
described in the paper "A classical analogue of entanglement" by Daniel
Collins and Sandu Popescu.

There is one decisive difference between quantum and classical (statistical)
teleportation and superdense coding. A qubit can be in a pure (non-
statistical) state whereas your pbit has to be in a mixed (statistical) state.
So the interesting thing is that phenomena which classically only worked in
the setting of statistical physics now also work in quantum mechanics without
statistics.

(Of course this is not a big practical difference since we as classical humans
need statistics to interpret quantum mechanics.)

The same goes for entanglement, by the way.

Your classical analogy for teleportation is very similar to the following
