What's This?

Soon Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won’t be the only semi-average
person who can talk a good quantum computing game.

On Wednesday, IBM unveiled the world’s first cloud-based quantum computing
experience. Starting today, regular humans will be able to access real quantum
computing hardware based in IBM’s T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown
Heights, NY, which means virtually anyone can run quantum computing
experiments from the comfort of their lab, office or living room couch.

Quantum computing is like regular computing in that it can use computational
power to help figure things out, but is also completely unlike it. Traditional
computers rely on information in bits represented as 1’s and 0’s; things are
one or the other, or on or off. In quantum computing, there are quantum bits
or qubits that can actually have two states at once (a superposition). It’s a
kind of computing that actually better correlates to nature and allows
scientists to work on problems at both an exponential and molecular level.

“It gives you access to a much broader and larger space of computations,” said
Jerry M. Chow, IBM’s Manager of Experimental Quantum Computing Group. Chow is
part of the team bringing Quantum computing to the cloud.

“It’s a web-based platform for public to access to run quantum algorithm and
quantum circuits on a real quantum processor in our labs,” said Chow. “We want
people to program their own algorithms and learn what it means to do quantum
computing.”

They will be learning though, on a somewhat reduced scale. First of all, it’s
not a true, universal quantum computer that is both exponentially faster than
traditional computers and can be programmed to work on virtually any task. And
while such a computer might offer up to 100 quantum bits of performance, IBM’s
cloud-based quantum computer will have just 5. It’s also just one quantum
processor — as opposed to an array. IBM plans to add qubits and even change
processor configurations over time.

According to Chow, IBM’s custom-built quantum processor is a silicon wafer
etched with super-conducting metal (niobium and aluminum). In order to
function as a quantum computer, it has to be super-cooled at all times. The
system sits at the bottom of refrigeration system where the temperature is
roughly 0.015 degrees above absolute zero.

Since it’s just one processor and the cloud-based quantum computing
environment will be open to virtually anyone, Chow’s team has set up a queuing
system and even a sort of virtual currency, called Q-Coins. Everyone who
registers gets coins and can earn more by completing tutorials. The coins are
used to run the tests against the Quantum silicon and get replenished when the
experiment is done.

place to keep track of your results.

Access to the real quantum computer will also reveal errors or “noise in the
system,” which can help programmers refine their quantum algorithms. The
environment will also include a simulator that will let you compare your
results to those from the hardware or simply practice running error-free
quantum algorithms.

The IBM Quantum Computing Experience includes user guides, tutorials and
examples. However, it’s not simply designed to educate the world on the
possibilities of quantum computing.

“For casual, new person to quantum computing, this is where you can learn
through examples. For research community and people who know a bit about this,
this is a really high-functioning, high-quality system to test out new ideas,
write papers and perform research on,” said Chow.

Put simply, real breakthroughs could happen on this quantum platform and in
the cloud.

Process that for minute.
