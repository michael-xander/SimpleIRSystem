# How fast is Google's quantum computer compared to a PC?

Even Google’s artificial intelligence research labs can sometimes find that
they just don’t have enough computing power available to them. This is despite
Google owning powerful computers that just about any country in the world.

As a result of finding some problems in the AI field too difficult to solve
using conventional computers, Google has turned its interest to quantum
computers. These systems can solve problems that traditional PC computers just
cannot handle. This is because quantum systems tap into the mystic world of
quantum mechanics.

To satisfy its ambitions, Google acquired the Canadian company D-Wave Systems
as part of its ambitious plans to accelerate their machine learning programs,
which will facilitate everything from faster search to health focused
businesses. Google’s interest was fueled by its desire to get hold of the
D-Waves x-2, the first quantum computer that has a 1,000 qu-bits quantum
processor, which Google claims is 100 million times faster than a conventional
one core PC.

Google’s Hartmut Neven, head of the Quantum AI Lab, explains: "We found that
for problem instances involving nearly 1,000 binary variables, quantum
annealing significantly outperforms its classical counterpart, simulated
annealing. It is more than 10 to the power of 8 times faster than simulated
annealing running on a single core".

Some serious caveats around the D-Wave’s computer as it can perform only a
limited set of quantum calculations, and just a few people know how to shape
problems suitably for its purpose. As a result, Google has running only
limited test operations on the D-Wave system, rather than the code used in the
company’s day-to-day operations.

Despite being confident that its quantum computer can blitz a single-core PC
-- others have been skeptical about the D-Wave x-2’s capabilities -- the
technology is unlikely to move into production anytime soon, as Neven
explained.

"While these results are intriguing and very encouraging, there is more work
ahead to turn quantum-enhanced optimization into a practical technology".
