Quantum error correction is an important research area of quantum information.
This paper proposes one kind of quantum CSS code for burst errors. Two
construction methods are given of the proposed CSS code obtaining from
classical cyclic code. Using these methods, a group of CSS codes of length 15
and 30 suitable for burst errors are obtained. In conclusion, the capability
of correcting burst errors of the quantum CSS codes is much larger than their
capability of correcting random errors.
