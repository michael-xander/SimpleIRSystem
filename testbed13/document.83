The Center for Spintronics and Quantum Computation is part of the California
NanoSystems Institute (CNSI) based at the University of California - Santa
Barbara. This multidisciplinary research center provides a focus for rapidly
expanding research, education and training in spin-based electronics and
quantum computation, with an emphasis on the potential realization in coherent
electronic, magnetic and photonic nanostructures. The Center brings together
researchers from physics, materials science, electrical engineering, and
computer science to address new paradigms for quantum electronics that rely on
the electronic and photonic manipulation of quantum information in
semiconductors.

Several collaborative universities and industrial laboratories have
coordinated a national framework to aggressively pursue this effort. Members
include researchers from: University of Basel, UC Berkeley, Florida State
University, Hewlett Packard, IBM Research Division, Intel Corporation,
University of Iowa, University of Maryland, University of Minnesota, MIT,
Naval Research Laboratory, University of New South Wales, Pennsylvania State
University, University of Pittsburgh, Rockwell Science Center, Sun
Microsystems, Tohoku University, UC Santa Barbara and UC San Diego

The investigators involved with this Center provide a network of innovative
materials growth/processing capabilities, leading edge measurement and device
expertise, as well as substantial theoretical support. Several of the projects
are aimed at investigating the physics of quantum coherence and the
engineering of quantum computation in semiconductors.
