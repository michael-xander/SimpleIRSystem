#  Want to play with IBM’s quantum computer for free? Now you can

Quantum computing is expected to be the next big thing in computer technology,
far surpassing what modern day devices are capable of – and IBM just made its
state-of-the-art processor available for free to anyone interested in playing
with it online.

Beginning May 4, virtually anyone will be able to access IBM's quantum
processor. All they'll have to do is request an invitation from IBM and let
the company know how experienced they are with quantum computing.

However, no one will be denied access to the processor, a company spokesperson
told BBC.

The processor itself is located at the TJ Watson Research Center in Yorktown
Heights, New York. There, IBM keeps it stored inside a cryogenic refrigerator
at almost -460 degrees Fahrenheit (-273C, or near absolute zero), so that it
can keep cool while computing.

Those who want to access the quantum processor, however, will be able to stay
in the comfort of their homes or offices, using the cloud and their own
computer or mobile device.

_"This moment represents the birth of quantum cloud computing,"_ said Arvind
Krishna, senior vice president and director of IBM Research, in a statement.
_"By giving hands-on access to IBM's experimental quantum systems, the IBM
Quantum Experience will make it easier for researchers and the scientific
community to accelerate innovations in the quantum field, and help discover
new applications for this technology."_

While quantum computing is still in the early stages, IBM has grand visions
for the technology. Currently, computers are powered by transistors that can
only store one "bit" of information, which is displayed as a 1 or a 0. Quantum
computing, however, is based on superpositioning, or the idea that quantum
bits (qubits) can store both a 1 and a 0 simultaneously. As explained by
Wired, this means that two qubits could potentially have four values at the
same time: 00, 01, 10, and 11.

According to IBM, a quantum computer with just 50 qubits would be more
powerful than any of the supercomputers available today. The company thinks
that medium-size quantum processors of 50-100 qubits could be realized within
the next 10 years.

Until then, though, researchers will have to make do with IBM's current
processor, which is running five qubits. Even getting these qubits to run
reliably has been a challenge, as the processor is extremely sensitive to heat
as well as electromagnetic radiation, PC World reported.

The decision to allow free access to the processor was called a _"small but
very significant step"_ by Chris Ford, professor of quantum electronics at
Cambridge University, though he doesn't believe most people will be able to
use it.

_"This will only be useful for experts who know what they are doing, but the
very idea that it's available to all may bring quantum computing to the
attention of the general public, and encourage more people to be interested in
how physics makes this new form of computing possible,"_ he told the BBC.

However, David DiVincenzo of the Institute for Quantum Information at RWTH
Aachen University told Wired that he thinks IBM's access experiment could
potentially lead to far more substantial results.

_"I think,"_ he said, _"that someone out there will learn things about the
behavior of this quantum computer that its developers never thought of."_
