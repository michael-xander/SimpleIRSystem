# Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is an entirely new form of computing that, though still in
its early stages, has the potential to revolutionize how we solve highly
complex problems. Booz Allen is one of the first companies in the world to use
quantum computing to solve real-world problems. And we’re taking the lead in
bringing these solutions to our government and business clients.

The Promise of Quantum Computing

#### Optimal Solutions

When given a problem to solve, conventional computers typically consider many
or all of the possible outcomes. The explosion of data today only further
complicates that computing process. Quantum computers, however, can find
optimal solutions more directly, by taking advantage of natural quantum
phenomena.

#### Qubits

Quantum computers don’t rely on conventional transistor-based silicon
technology. Instead, they take advantage of the quantum-mechanical properties
of special materials to solve problems. While the bits used by conventional
computers have only two states—“off” or “on” (0 or 1)—the bits in quantum
computers (called qubits) have far more possible states. This makes it
possible for quantum computers to solve difficult problems in a completely
different way.

## Solving Real-World Problems

Quantum computing holds the potential to inspire breakthroughs throughout
government and industry. Its analytical capabilities can be applied to such
complex problems as:

  * __ System & Network Optimization
  * __ Vehicle routing 
  * __ Logistics
  * __ Job scheduling 

  * __ Drug discovery
  * __ Manufacturing
  * __ System Design 
  * __ Verification & Validation (V&amp;V;)

## Your Partner in Quantum Computing

Your Partner in Quantum Computing Booz Allen is now partnering with
government and business clients to develop cutting-edge quantum computing
solutions—including pilots and prototypes—that can break the computing
boundaries they now face.

As a pioneer in quantum computing, we have extensive experience embracing and
using the latest advances in quantum hardware. And with our team of more than
500 data scientists—one of the world’s largest—and our 100-year history as
management consultants, we’re putting in place real-world, sustainable quantum
solutions for our clients.
