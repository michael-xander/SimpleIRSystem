# Is D-Wave's quantum computer actually a quantum computer?

Jun 20, 2014 14 comments

  
Testing times for D-Wave Systems: the firm's 512-qubit processor

A team of quantum-computing experts in the US and Switzerland has published a
paper in _Science_ that casts doubt over the ability of the D-Wave Two quantum
processor to perform certain computational tasks. The paper, which first
appeared as a preprint earlier this year, concludes that the processor - built
by the controversial Canadian firm D-Wave Systems - offers no advantage over a
conventional computer when it is used to solve a benchmark computing problem.

While the researchers say that their results do not rule out the possibility
that the processor can outperform conventional computers when solving other
classes of problems, their work does suggest that evaluating the performance
of a quantum computer could be a much trickier task than previously thought.
D-Wave has responded by saying that the wrong benchmark problem was used to
evaluate its processor, while the US-Swiss team now intends to do more
experiments using different benchmarks.

### Quantum insights

D-Wave Two is the second generation of quantum processors sold by D-Wave
Systems and one of the devices is owned by NASA, Google and the Universities
Space Research Association. The company has also sold a system - claimed to be
the world's first commercially available quantum computer - to Lockheed
Martin. The tests on D-Wave Two were carried out by Matthias Troyer and
colleagues at ETH Zurich, the University of Southern California (USC), the
University of California Santa Barbara, Google and Microsoft.

Containing 512 quantum bits (qubits), the D-Wave Two processor was designed
specifically to perform a process called "quantum annealing", which is a
technique for finding the global minimum of a complicated mathematical
function. Unlike "conventional" quantum computers - which are kept in a
fragile quantum state throughout the calculation - quantum annealing involves
making a transition from a quantum to classical system. As a result, D-Wave's
approach might be more immune to noise, which can destroy conventional quantum
calculations. However, a quantum annealing processor is not a universal
computer like a PC and cannot be programmed to perform a range of tasks.

### Fiendishly difficult calculation

Troyer's team tested the processor by using it to solve a particularly
difficult task from condensed-matter physics involving "Ising spin glasses". A
spin glass is a magnetic material in which the individual magnetic moments -
or spins - interact with each other and are also located randomly throughout
the material. This is unlike conventional models of magnetic materials, in
which the spins are arranged on a regular lattice and tend to all point in
specific directions. Instead, the spin glass has an extremely complicated spin
configuration that is fiendishly difficult to calculate for large numbers of
spins. "Ising spin-glass problems are the 'native' problem that the [D-Wave
Two] is designed for," Troyer explained to _physicsworld.com_.

To evaluate the performance of D-Wave Two, the team measured how long it took
the processor to solve an Ising spin-glass problem and compared this with the
time it takes with a conventional, classical computer. This ratio, known as
the "quantum speed-up", is expected to be around one for small problems -
meaning classical devices can do the job just as well - but it should grow in
size as the problem becomes larger. In its test, the team carried out lots of
quantum and classical simulations on different spin glasses, in which the
number of spins and the interaction strengths were varied systematically.

### No speed-up found

The results, however, reveal no clear evidence of speed-up. While the D-Wave
Two processor was sometimes 10 times faster than the classical computer, it
was also sometimes more than 100 times slower. Troyer and colleagues put forth
several possible explanations for why speed-up was not seen. One is that
although D-Wave Two functions as a quantum processor, quantum annealing offers
no advantage over classical methods. Another possibility is that noise or
other operational problems mean that the device is not operating as a quantum
processor.

A third, intriguing prospect put forth by Troyer and colleagues is that speed-
up could still be seen when D-Wave Two is used to solve other types of
problems, even if it was not observed in the current test. Indeed, D-Wave
itself claims that research done by a team led by Helmut Katzgraber at Texas
A&amp;M University suggests that Ising spin-glass problems cannot be solved
quicker using quantum annealing. Moreover, Jeremy Hilton - D-Wave's vice-
president for processor development - points out more recent work done by Itay
Hen of USC and colleagues, which - he says - shows that "a new benchmark has
demonstrated better performance of the D-Wave 512 qubit processor over the
simulated annealing algorithm developed by Troyer _et al._"

### Better-suited problems

"Katzgraber argues that 3D spin glasses may be better test cases that 'might'
be better suited," says Troyer. "We have found a way to implement such
problems and are testing it now. Researchers at Google and NASA are also
searching if there are problem classes that may show quantum speed-up."

Troyer adds that the fundamental importance of the work presented in _Science_
is that it describes a method for measuring quantum speed-up for devices with
unknown potential, such as the D-Wave devices. With physicists worldwide
focused on making larger and more complex quantum processors, such measurement
techniques will become increasingly important.

The benchmark testing is described in _Science_.

> D-Wave's quantum computer is semiclassical one. But the problem is somewhere
else. I already explained many times here, the computational power of quantum
computers remains limited with the same uncertainty principle, like this one
of classical ones - just from opposite side of the ratio of calculation
precision and processing speed. We are talking about computational power here,
i.e. the product of processing speed and byte width. The quantum computers are
fast, but quite fuzzy and approximate. For to achieve the same resolution,
like for example 64-bit computer, you should repeat the calculations multiple-
times and average the results. After then the advantage of speed is over...  
  
BTW This theorem has been already proven for throughput of quantum
communication, which represents the principal portion of every quantum
computer performance.

> Not quite correct. If, for example, quantum annealing can solve a problem in
polynomial time that a conventional system solves in exponential time, the the
linear term (number of "averages") is insignificant for a data set of
nontrivial size. Even taking "fuzziness" into account, there hasn't been that
kind of speed up. But I think you are fundamentally right. Maybe there's some
"quantumness" going on in the box, but the high error rate of the qbits and
outside interference might be swamping any computational speed up. That
explains why it's 100 times faster one run and 1000 times slower on the next.

Personally, I am somewhat cautious about absolute "proofs" and statements
based on them. See here for a list of such bold assertions:  
  
listverse.com…  
  
Regarding computational speed limits, there are many non-quantum or
"classical" architectures: Harvard, neural, genetic, dataflow, analog, fuzzy,
... any of which is faster at certain problem classes. All existing
architecture rely on imprecise computation to some degree. While it might
require infinite resources to compute an "exact" answer, it turns out that
"exact" is rarely practical nor even necessary. The easiest example is that
floating point representation on a binary machine is approximate, but nobody
cares. The human brain approximates reality for us... that's why we fall for
magic tricks... but we manage just fine. A PCB autorouter produces a sub-
optimal layout that works great in practice.  
  
I cannot say if D-Wave works or not. I have not seen nor examined the system.
Also, I cannot say definitively that a practical, effective pure quantum or
quantum annealing system won't ever be built. That kind of prediction seems a
bit rash to me.

> Working quantum computers have been around for some years now in one form or
another. These computers have shown the expected speed up on, for example,
Shor's algorithm for factoring integers. The practical performance of such
systems, especially as they scale up, is a hot topic and definitely worthy of
discussion. As the poster ragtime points out, now that we can perform quantum
calculations on real machines, and those machines are beginning to scale up,
we are encountering performance limits in translating the outputs to a
usable/observable form. Quantum computing is here. Just a matter of time
before it becomes ubiquitous.

### "computer" means "universal", full stop!

> "..a quantum annealing processor is not a universal computer.."  
  
Well this, if true, gives a rather trivial reason why it is not a quantum
computer. That may be rather irrelevant in a sense since it's not the quantum
aspect. It's not a quantum computer because it's not a computer (and possibly
for other reasons as well, of course).  
  
Is the author familiar with Turing's work from the advent of computers?
...with the fact that a quantum computer has the same 'computability'
properties as a Turing machine? Of course the big factor here is speed. But I
can invent a specialized 'processor' which is as fast as anything possibly
could be, if the problem processed is sufficiently specialized. Just put the
answer into its memory, for regurgitation when asked. Just don't ask it to do
anything else than to answer the question(s) for which its memory already
contains the answer.  
  
So the article gives us little information, it seems.

> Funny, but in a fashion, that seems to be the way the universe behaves. If
something "works," it works immediately, every where, any time. Otherwise it
doesn't. That's not quite teleological. Physics tries to explain "how"
whatever works does so (in terms of other things known to work that it depends
on .. i.e., causality). Engineering explores the _"timeless potential
landscape of technology"_ (Eric Drexler) in order to "find" precisely the
thing that works the particular way somebody (us) wants it to work (so we can
use that). "Why" seems to be a different kind of question .. maybe
metaphysics. :-}

### to perhaps further explain myself

> "Funny, but in a fashion, that seems to be the way the universe
behaves......"  
  
Being a reply to me, and since I have no clue as to what any of that reply
means, maybe I can rephrase my earlier comment.  
  
My intention had merely been to point out that the author of the article is
telling us virtually nothing, as long as he does not even attempt to explain
which computable 'things' this "processor" is able to compute, and so, which
of them it cannot. If the former is in some sense small, and so the other
large, the question of how close it is to being a quantum computer is of
little general interest---or perhaps, the answer is simply 'no, not even
close'.  
  
Its speed might still be very interesting for anyone immersed in special
computations of those things it supposedly does do quickly.

### Too cute

> Well, perhaps we both were being a bit too clever. I mean, after all, a
computer is not generally thought of as a notebook, where facts are written
down and regurgitated when you flip to the page. Likewise the universe is not
often thought of as a machine that simply connects every effect precisely with
its causes.  
  
To return to the discussion at hand of the article, I too am not sure either
whether D-Wave is a computer, is a quantum computer, or whether/exactly what
it does compute at all. If computing means solve specific problems - run an
algorithm - then practically everything "computes" or can be described as
handling information (or entropy) in some way, e.g., analog devices, even
levers or heat engines.

### my suggestions again misunderstood

> "...a computer is not generally thought of as a notebook, where facts are
written down and regurgitated..."  
  
This remark is another complete misunderstanding of what is happening here,
supposedly criticizing quite the opposite to what I said twice. I could not
agree more with the remark. Even the article's author already said this non-
computer processor is not a computer, but called it a processor. The most
primitive case of a processor is one that just regurgitates, being especially
basic and trivial because the total of all questions it can answer is
obviously finite. But with its (initially blank) memory modelled as
potentially infinite (not actually of course, and this is just standard
computation theory), even a 150-year old adding machine can deal with an
infinity (potentially) of questions.  
  
It is pretty obvious that the machine of the article is quite a sophisticated
processor. But the article is entirely vague on details, and so is really of
no interest on its own.
