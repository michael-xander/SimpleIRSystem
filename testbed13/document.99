# Physicists explain how to solve difficult mathematical problems with time
travel computing

If the universe allows 'open timelike curves', particles travelling back in
time along them could help to perform currently intractable computations. Even
though such curves don't allow for interaction with anything in the past,
researchers writing in npj Quantum Information show there is a gain in
computational power as long as the time-travelling particle is entangled with
one kept in the present.Adapted from npj Quantum Information

Sending a locked message back in time of which no one will ever read the
contents can help solve difficult problems, according to an international team
of scientists. They state that if one were to entangle the locked message with
another laboratory system before sending it back in time, then the
entanglement creates a strange effect in quantum physics that sees it
establish correlations between the message which has been sent back in time
and the laboratory system that it has become entangled with. This, they say,
can help solve difficult mathematical problems.

Dave Bacon of Google proved a decade ago that a time-travelling quantum
computer was able to solve NP-complete – a group of difficult mathematical
equations. However, Bacon's quantum computer was only able to travel through
"closed timelike curves" – a path through the fabric of spacetime that loops
which is made possible through wormholes in spacetime. Physicists argue closed
timelike curves can be dangerous due to causality – the theory in which
someone could go back in time and alter the future, such as killing your own
grandad – as the classic example goes.

Breaking the flow of time can wreak havoc on quantum physics, with researchers
proving the basic principles of quantum physics cease in closed timelike
curves. However, new research, led by Mile Gu from the Centre for Quantum
Technologies (CQT) at the National University of Singapore and Tsinghua
University in Beijing, shows quantum computers can solve these problems when
travelling in "open timelike curves", which do not have an effect on causality
due to the fact that they do not interact with objects in the past, according
to the study published in npj Quantum Information.

"Nevertheless, the strange quantum properties that permit 'impossible'
computations are left intact," read a press release. "We avoid 'classical'
paradoxes, like the grandfathers paradox, but you still get all these weird
results," says Gu.

"Whenever we present the idea, people say no way can this have an effect,"
says Jayne Thompson, a co-author at CQT. "The reason there is an effect is
because some information is stored in the entangling correlations: this is
what we're harnessing."
