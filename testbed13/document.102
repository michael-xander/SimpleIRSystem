Quantum computers aren't for browsing the Internet, checking email, or running
standard software.

Instead, they rely on the underpinnings of quantum mechanics, a branch of
physics that's defied conventional understanding for about 100 years, to
manipulate individual particles and solve previously unsolvable problems.

If you wanted to say that a quantum computer runs on magic, you wouldn't be
too far off. Science fiction daydreams like time travel and teleportation are
run of the mill when we're dealing with objects this tiny (think: _smaller
than an individual atom_). The "rules" don't apply.  

This opens up some exciting possibilities, especially in a branch of
mathematics known as optimization, which is pretty much what it sounds like:
finding the best answer from a large set of potential answers. For such a
specific slice of math, this field addresses some of the most tangible
problems in the real world. What's the best route for a UPS truck to make its
deliveries? How do you schedule flights at an airport to keep things running
smoothly?

Conventional computers are ill-equipped to handle certain optimization
calculations. Professor Daniel Lidar, scientific director at the USC Lockheed-
Martin Center for Quantum Computing, says that "it would take many times the
age of the universe to try to identify the folded states of a protein, and yet
nature can do this in seconds, maybe minutes. It's had billions of years to
think about it."

In a way, quantum computing taps into nature's ability to interact with the
world. That might be a tough thought to comprehend, but it's only the tip of
the iceberg.

general) is that the simple act of observation changes the outcome of an
event. We are limited by the precision of our instruments, and this is
especially true of a scientist's inquisitive eyeballs. A quantum particle
observed or otherwise measured is a quantum particle changed

crunch through its operations. Just like bits, qubits can represent either a
