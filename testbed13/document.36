# IBM Quantum Computing project: reaching a super position on superposition

The race to build the first quantum computers is on.

Microsoft's efforts in this space are supported by a dedicated subsection of
the Microsoft Research division -- and IBM's work in this space is no less
far-reaching.

A universal quantum computer uses quantum mechanics to process massive amounts
of data and perform computations in powerful new ways not possible with
today's conventional computers.

But before we can start to discuss the implications for software application
developers 'programming to' (or from) the power of quantum machines, we need
to build them and stabilise them first.

**Quantum information is extremely fragile**

The workhorse of the quantum computer is the quantum bit. Many scientists are
tackling the challenge of building qubits, but quantum information is
extremely fragile and requires special techniques to preserve the quantum
state.

In terms of news, the U.S. Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity
(IARPA) programme has notified IBM that it will award its scientists a multi-
year research grant to advance the building blocks for a universal quantum
computer.

**Heat kills quantum**

The major hurdles here include creating qubits of high quality and packaging
them together in a scalable form so they can perform complex calculations in a
controllable way - limiting the errors that can result from heat and
electromagnetic radiation.

According to IBM, this type of leap forward in computing could one day shorten
the time to discovery for life-saving cancer drugs to a fraction of what it is
today; unlock new facets of artificial intelligence by vastly accelerating
machine learning; or safeguard cloud computing systems to be impregnable from
cyber-attack.

Earlier this year, IBM scientists demonstrated breakthroughs to detect quantum
errors by combining superconducting qubits in lattices on computer chips - and
whose quantum circuit design is the only physical architecture that can scale
to larger dimensions.

**Superconducting qubits**

Under the LogiQ programme, IBM's research team will continue to pursue the
leading approach for building a universal quantum computer by using
superconducting qubits.

By encoding the superconducting qubits into a logical qubit, one should then
be able to perform true quantum computation. These logical qubit designs will
be foundational to future, more complex quantum computing systems.

"We are at a turning point where quantum computing is moving beyond theory and
experimentation to include engineering and applications," said Arvind Krishna,
senior vice president and director, IBM Research.

LogiQ envisions that program success will require a multi-disciplinary
approach to come up with new technical solutions that will better deal with
the fragility of quantum information due to system imperfections, errors and
environmental influences.
