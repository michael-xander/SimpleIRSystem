# What math is used in the theory of quantum computing?

up vote 4 down vote favorite

I'd like to know what rung of the math ladder one need be on to grasp how a
quantum computer computes.

I realize this might not be a simple answer, so I'm just looking for an idea
of the broad topics required.

Thanks.

For the foundation you need to understand linear algebra, projective geometry
and how to build circuits out of AND, OR, NOT gates. For the algorithms
themselves, you need to know a little about rational approximations and the
Fourier transformation. You can start to learn about Quantum Computing from
here but I also recommend working through the book he wrote.

Since all quantum algorithms I know, deal with finite dimensional system,
knowledge of unitary groups $\text{U}(N)$ is important, because it governs the
evolution of the finite quantum system without relaxation. For the QA to
approximate the Jones Polynomial, it doesn't hurt to know something about knot
theory.
