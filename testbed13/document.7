# D-Wave confirmed as the first real quantum computer by new research

  * By Joel Hruska on June 12, 2014 at 10:30 am
  * Comment

Ever since D-Wave arrived on the scene with a type of quantum computer capable
of performing a problem-solving process called annealing, questions have flown
thick and fast over whether or not the system really functioned -- and, if it
did function, whether it was actually performing quantum computing. A new
paper by researchers who have spent time with the D-Wave system appears to
virtually settle this question -- the D-Wave system appears to actually
perform quantum annealing. It would therefore be the first real quantum
computer.

Up until now, it's been theorized that D-Wave might be a _simulator_ of a
quantum computer based on some less-than-clear benchmark results. This new
data seems to disprove that theory. Why? Because it shows evidence of
entanglement. Quantum entanglement refers to a state in which two distinct
qubits (two units of quantum information) become linked. If you measure the
value of one entangled qubit as 0, its partner will also measure 0. Measure a
1 at the first qubit, and the second qubit will also contain a 1, with no
evidence of communication between them.

Researchers working with a D-Wave system have now illustrated that D-Wave
qubit pairs become entangled, as did an entire set of eight qubits. (The
D-Wave uses blocks of eight qubits, as shown below). [DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.4.021041 - "Entanglement in a Quantum
Annealing Processor"]

The D-Wave 2 Vesuvius chip, with 512 qubits

Assuming the experimental evidence holds up, this fundamentally shifts the
burden of proof from "Prove D-Wave is quantum," to "Prove the D-Wave _isn't_
quantum." Evidence of entanglement is the gold standard for whether or not a
system is actually performing quantum computing.

### So, now what?

Now that we have confirmation that D-Wave is a quantum computer (or at least,
as close to confirmation as we can likely get), the question is, how do we
improve it? As we've previously covered, the D-Wave isn't always faster than a
well-tuned classical system. Instead of arguing over whether or not an Nvidia
Tesla GPU cluster with customized software is a better or worse investment
than a supercomputer that's cryogenically cooled and computes via niobium
loops, we're going to look at what D-Wave needs to do to improve the
capabilities of its own system. As Ars Technica points out, its architecture
is less than ideal -- for some problems, D-Wave can only offer less than 100
effective qubits despite some newer systems having 512 qubits in total,
because its architecture is only sparsely connected. Each group of eight
qubits connects to itself, but each island of eight qubits has just eight
connections to two other adjacent qubits.

The D-Wave Two's cryogenic cooling system. There's a qubit chip in there,
somewhere.

D-Wave has stated that it intends to continue increasing the number of qubits
it offers in a system, but we can't help wondering if the company would see
better performance if it managed to scale up the number of interconnects
between the qubit islands. A quantum system with 512 qubits but more than just
two connections to other islands might allow for much more efficient problem
modeling and better overall performance.

Inevitably this kind of questioning turns to the topic of when we'll see this
kind of technology in common usage -- but the answer, for now, is "you won't."
There are a number of reasons why quantum computing may never revolutionize
_personal_ computing, many of them related to the fact that it relies on large
amounts of liquid nitrogen. According to D-Wave's documents for initial
deployments, its first systems in 2010 required 140L of LN2 to initially fill
and boiled off about 3L of fluid a day. Total tank capacity was 38L, which
required twice-weekly fill-ups. The Elan2 LN2 production system is designed to
produce liquid nitrogen in an office setting and can apparently create about
5L of LN2 per day at an initial cost of $9500. [Read: Google’s Quantum
Computing Playground turns your PC into a quantum computer.]

Did I mention that you have to pay attention to Earth's magnetic field when
installing a D-Wave system, the early systems created about 75dB of noise, and
it weighs 11,000 pounds? Many of these issues confronted early computers as
well, but the LN2 issue is critical -- quantum computing, for now, requires
such temperatures -- and unless we can figure out a way to bring these systems
up to something like ambient air temperature, they'll never fly for personal
use. Rest assured that lots of research is being done on the topic of room-
temperature qubits, though!

Can it play games at 4k res and 60 fps?

    * eonvee375

if your question is not facetious then No,

plus quantum "cpu"s are just another adition to our hardware for now, on its
own its pretty useless (for now)

its like first room classical computers (needed at least 20 people to operate)  
20years later we had a personal desktop

so we really just need to wait and see ^^ and by that i mean work on the
problems

      * TishaAchillesico

my Aunty  
Allison recently got a nice 6 month old Jaguar by working from a macbook.this
website C­a­s­h­d­u­t­i­e­s­.­C­O­M­

        * eonvee375

nice! who gives a crap again?

          * Ricoh123

Those who are so short sighted that they can't see their hands flapping about
in front of their faces sure don't !

        * ramsey44

Nevermind the jaguar, I'll just get your auntie.

    * jburt56

Beyond that. It'll project an alternative reality into your mind
indistinguishable from real life.

    * massau

yes and not. it might or might not play it at that resolution untill you
observe it.

ok no the real deal. quantum computing is probalystic computing. you load a
Qbit with a state where it has an equal chance for certain numbers. each
calculation changes the chance that a certain number comes up. at the end of
the calculation you get the most probable aswere.  
it usefull for decrytion and maybe AI and some other NP problems.

    * Taima

Current hardware can play games at that rate, no need for awesome future pcs
for that, eheh.

  * Andre Oliveira Dias

We dont need personal quantum computers. We have the internet, we are
connected to them. The network is the computer. Our thin clients will be our
phones and whatever is connected. What we need now is to improve internet
access (OMG IPV6 is so behind schedule), improve quantum computers and improve
the programming of quantum computers.

    * Matt Menezes

This is sort of off topic, but it's no wonder that IPV6 is most abundant in
China because they lack IPV4 addresses (the US controls them, and we hoard
them), so instead of NAT'ing the hell out of their few IPV4 addresses, they
run their local computers with IPV6 and only ISPs connect to the rest of the
web with IPV4.

      * anon

8 months late but china has tons of ipv4… tons.

        * Matt Menezes

I mean, Stanford and MIT each hold more IPv4 addresses than China. Considering
their population is 3-4x the US's, that hardly seems "fair". Not that it
bothers me. At my work, we all get externally facing IP's, while many places
have to use NAT and only have a single, external WAN IP.

    * Ulrich Werner

No, we don't need even more centralized hardware and thin clients. In many
respects that's a very bad idea and would undermine the democracy of the
internet. Computing power needs to be in the hand of everyone. (This sounds
like a Marxist manifesto, I know…)

      * Andre Oliveira Dias

I agree, but as a later stage. The centralized model is just more economic
efficient at first.

      * massau

it should be a mesh like computer. But the problem is the bosses are the
owners of the interconnection mesh so ISP will still have a lot of power.

      * Benny X

the 'democracy of the internet' is an illusion as is. who controls your
access? your ISP. where do they get their access from? whoever controls the
pipes. that's some very centralized control right there. computing power in
the hands of everyone is useless these days without a data network.

        * Ulrich Werner

Sure thing. But so is any other network, be it gas distribution or
electricity. Someone always controls the flow as long as it is not properly
decentralized (which could be done in the second case by, e.g., grassrooting
electricity production…).

As a matter of fact, the USA have one of the worse systems (in developed
countries) when it comes to ISPs -- very little competition, which makes for
very high prices and excellent centralized control -- just the right
combination for these corp.s to tackle net neutrality. The networks are freer
in other countries.

But I was aiming at something else, the thread-opener advocated a world of
thin clients, i.e., an "appliancized" infrastructure. I'm very much against
that. Not only because my work revolves heavily around local hardware and will
so also in the future, but also because even disconnected computers are useful
whereas disconnected "dumb terminals" are useless.

      * Falcon D. Stormvoice

No, you sound very capitalistic. Capitalism always distributes more power to
everyone, which is why everyone can have a car and a computer in a
capitalistic society; whereas these amazing things were once reserved only for
the richest of the rich.

Now, net neutrality enforced by bureaucrats who had no hand in creating the
internet, that sounds a little bit like Marxism.

        * Ulrich Werner

I disagree on both points. Capitalism tends to feed off inequality. *Someone*
always pays for that car and that computer. "Capitalism floats all boats" is
an aging assumption (Read Piketty's book "Capital in the 21st century" or
Graeber's book "Debt" for very recent ideas about that.) But that's not the
point here and we don't need to fight over it. (And no, I don't care much for
Marxism either.)

Net neutrality is not *enforced by bureaucrats*. It's one of the very
foundational principles of the internet (read about the history of the
internet on, e.g., wikibooks). Giving a corporation the power to limit
bandwidth according to the amount of money paid means realistically higher
prices for everyone. But especially it will curb the rapid development of
internet startups. Still, this is also off topic. I was challenging the first
commenter's assumption that outsourcing and centralizing computing power would
in any way benefit progress.

          * Falcon D. Stormvoice

Yes, it is off topic. But you contradict yourself. Corporations who produce
the internet already have the power to mete out bandwidth, what you are
proposing is that they are prevented from ever using that power. So who is
responsible for controlling them and taking away that ability? A private
entity? No, bureaucrats.

Sure, the truth about capitalism is falling out of vogue -- that's because
when societies achieve affluence, they have to reject what made them
successful and self-destruct. But we've certainly seen it lift all boats in
the past. Then certain politicians try to get people worked up over the fact
that some boats rose higher -- a lot higher! -- than other boats. But you can
easily tell that capitalism works with one simple observation -- whenever
someone provides an example of it failing, they can only dig up scenarios that
heavily involved government interference and control already, such as health
care. If you don't want to fight over it, don't fight over it. I'm not
assaulting anyone with these meagre words.

" I was challenging the first commenter's assumption that outsourcing and
centralizing computing power would in any way benefit progress."

That's what I was mostly agreeing with.

          * Ulrich Werner

I'm honestly happy that it is still possible to have a civilized discussion on
the internet. :D

        * Randy

No. Capitalism feeds the rich and powerful, the minority, at the expensive of
the poor, the majority. Capitalism will always fail. Always has and always
will. Economies must be well regulated to protect people and the environment.

PS: The government created the internet.

          * Falcon D. Stormvoice

You're repeating a falsehood. The government contracted private companies to
network together less than 40 computers. That's not the internet, that's less
than my high school computer lab.

Capitalism has never failed, and when it was tried in even small doses, it
spawned national superpowers and created technology booms that were brought to
the masses. Computers can belong to poor people because of capitalism. The
market working.

          * Randy

You are comparing a room full of idental computers, or computers which all
share standard parts, in 2014, to connecting completely different computers
using custom designed connectors and software in the late 60s. The computers
were often larger than those cute little computer labs. And you didn't connect
a few computer in California to the East Coast in a few months. This is
completely thanks to government funding.

I'll never understand how someone can believe this. There is no example of a
true "fully capitalist" economy, it couldn't work. Its the opposite extreme of
communism and both are impossible in the real world. There would be no roads,
space exploration, public schools, universal healthcare (something ALL first
world countries except the US have), etc in a fully capitalist economy. The
market has to be well regulated to protect the people, environment, and the
economy.

        * Ricoh123

Negative.

Capitalism distributes power to the few, which is why only the few can have a
luxury boat or luxury car with employees to perform maintenance and laborious
tasks on them.

The latest and greatest technology is always reserved for the rich.

Space flight for $200,000 per trip anyone?

          * Falcon D. Stormvoice

The latest and greatest technology wouldn't exist without the rich to pay for
it first. Then, it eventually finds its way to the common man. Only a weapon's
grade moron could look at a system like this, and think 'no, we need to be
more like Cuba'.

Is there some great injustice in someone having a big boat?

          * Ricoh123

Later stages of capitalism shows huge concentration of wealth.

It centralises the majority of wealth into tiny pockets of the few.

In order for the rich to fund early adoption of technology, they must first
use the masses to fund it.

I didn't say it doesn't work. I'm merely pointing out how unfair it is to
literally billions of people. Some of which will suffer greatly.

          * Ricoh123

And by the way. Every so often, the latest version of capitalism always
collapses.

Never in history has it not collapsed.

          * Randy

No one is saying "lets do a soviet, chinese, or cuba 'communist" system!" for
two reasons. One, none had true communism, and two, most people reason true
communism cannot happen in the real world. They were not socialist either.

      * chaiguy

Only the physical machinery need be centralized. The information, including
the programs that are running on them can still be distributed and
decentralized. Therefore it's not a threat to the democracy of the internet so
long as there are enough hardware providers; it's merely a question of where
your code is running.

    * GregR

Anyone who relies upon the network, or ANY 3rd party for security is out of
touch with reality.

    * PeteEllis

Thin clients are for people who don't mind having all their data scrutinized
by the governemnt. Thin clients can be convenient but they are anathema to
privacy which is the corner stone of liberty.

  * Jewy McJew

Keep it up D-Wave, do it for Canada!!!

  * ramsey44

The current dwave machines do not use liquid cooling at all; personal
computing is dead, everybody will use dwave in the cloud.

    * massau

why the hell do you want to use the cloud. all your data is somewhere you do
not know. who does your computation. what if you stop paying is all your data
gone.  
even worst no internet means no processing power nor storage you will be left
with a dumb brick.

also quantum computers can only be better than normal computing if the quantum
parallelism can be used. this means some NP problems the P they will be as
fast.

      * ramsey44

Why not use the cloud? Like all great technologies it is powerful and
convenient. There are always risks, but that's life in the modern world. You
don't want to deal with this? Then don't put your money in the bank either,
dig a ditch and hide it in your backyard.

Quantum parallelism/entanglement, that is what has been proven on the Dwave
machine. The next step is increasing the size of the processor until normal
computers can no longer compete.

        * massau

i just told you that a quantum computer is not always faster than a normal
computer. it is only good in certain workloads.

you could compair it to a multi core it is better if the algorithm can be made
parallel but it is useless if it cannot be done.

the cloud still sucks you have to pay multiple companies for just getting
there service. there are good parts of the cloud but this is mostly for
companies.

we can already do 50 % of what we want to do with a computer.  
75% with a computer+ internet and 99% whit a computer+ internet + phone .  
so do you really want to give away your personal computing power?

maybe one great thing for cloud computing is game rendering so you can game on
all your low power devices. but you still want most of your aps to be local.  
otherwise you get something like the photoshop subscription model for
everything you do.

          * ramsey44

Can a quantum computer always be better than a classical (normal) computer in
all cases/problems (parallel or not)? I believe so, check out "universal"
quantum computer.

          * massau

No, it still is a turing machine so it could be as fast on normal problems.
but faster in certain special workloads NP problems like prime factoring,
shortest path search, some AI parts.

the first consumer quantum computers will be just like a GPU it will be used
as a coprocessor and you only use it on the workloads where it is faster or
more efficient.

so if you really want something that replaces the normal processor than it has
to be a "hyper computer" or just be a lot cheaper and faster than current
computers.

this is where Qcomputers can be faster :

If I can't implant this, I'll pass ;)

    * Falcon D. Stormvoice

No, go ahead, implant it. Considering that it only needs liquid nitrogen to
function, I'm sure you'll be fine.

  * Nick

So if its quantum, does that mean it is both quantum computing and not quantum
computing at the same time?

    * Mirimon

relationships are quantum as well, I am both married and dating at the same
