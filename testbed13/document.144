Think your computer is pretty fast? Think again.

Compared with the newest quantum computer from D-Wave Systems of Burnaby,
British Columbia, even the world's most powerful supercomputers are ploddingly
slow, The New York Times reports.

The ability of quantum computing to solve problems thousands of times faster
than traditional computers is attracting attention from some of the world's
largest and most powerful institutions. [10 Technologies That Will Transform

Search engine giant Google announced today (May 16) it was teaming with NASA
Ames Research Center and the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) to
create the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, to be housed later this year
at the NASA Ames facility in Moffett Field, Calif., northwest of San Jose.

Their new computing system, dubbed D-Wave Two, is D-Wave's second quantum
computer and the second to be installed in California. Lockheed Martin, the
world's largest aerospace and defense company, purchased a D-Wave quantum
computer in 2011 and installed it at the University of Southern California
(USC) in Los Angeles, according to Nature.com.

Though D-Wave reportedly doesn't release any price information on its
computers, the BBC states the D-Wave Two cost about $15 million and will be
housed in a box the size of a garden shed that will cool the computer's
quantum chip to temperatures approaching absolute zero.

**Lightning quick**

Quantum computers have been a twinkle in the eye of computer designers for
years, and have only recently entered the development stage. Compared with the
familiar desktop and laptop computers now available, they should be capable of
making calculations several orders of magnitude faster.

Conventional computers rely upon codes expressed as binary digits, or bits,
with a value of either 0 or 1. A computer with a two-bit register therefore
has a total of four (2 to the second power) different states: 00, 01, 10 or
11.

A quantum computer, however, isn't limited to just two values in each bit.
Each quantum bit, or qubit, can exist as a 0, a 1, or both a 0 and a 1
simultaneously, a state known as "superposition."

Quantum computers achieve this tremendous feat by taking advantage of the
strange nuances of quantum mechanics, the physics theory that describes a
microscopic world in which a particle can exist in two different places at
once, or spin in opposite directions at the same time. [Twisted Physics: 7
Mind-Blowing Findings]

**Testing the D-Wave**

Why would entities like Google and NASA -- which already own countless high-
powered computers -- invest heavily in the relatively new field of quantum
computing?

Many skeptics wondered the same thing, and have challenged D-Wave to
substantiate its claims that quantum computers are worth the price tag and the
considerable hype the machines receive.

To put its computers to the test, D-Wave brought in Catherine C. McGeoch,
professor in technology and society at Amherst College in Massachusetts. She
gave the D-Wave computer a few problems to solve involving optimization, The
New York Times reported.

Optimization problems, in simple terms, are comparable to figuring out the
best route a traveling salesman should take to visit all his customers in a
certain period of time, weighing in factors like traffic, weather and other
variables.

**D-Wave aces the test**

McGeoch's results were striking: The D-Wave machine was 3,600 times as fast as
a conventional computing system, according to the Times, proving the quantum
computer's potential at solving large, complex optimization problems.

"There could be a tipping point," McGeoch told the Times. "If the problems get
big enough, conventional systems break down. In theory, you could solve a
large number of optimization problems."

Some researchers, however, doubt that quantum computers actually perform so
well, and the practical potential of quantum computers is a hotly debated
topic.

"Every problem we have tested can still be solved faster on classical
computers," Daniel Lidar, director of the USC computing center, told Nature.

**Myriad applications**

Google is interested in using the new D-Wave computer to solve problems
involving machine learning, in which computers analyze information patterns to
make accurate predictions of optimal outcomes in highly complex systems, such
as global climate models.

"If we want to cure diseases, we need better models of how they develop,"
Google officials said in a news release. "If we want to create effective
environmental policies, we need better models of what's happening to our
climate."

The D-Wave Two machine Google, NASA and USRA have agreed to share will operate
on a 512-qubit register, with plans to upgrade the machine to 2,048 qubits
when that capacity becomes available within a year or two, the Times reports.
