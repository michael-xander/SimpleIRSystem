I wrote an answer for this question which I will quote here since it might be
useful if you know a bit of quantum mechanics: What is the relation between
quantum computing and quantum mechanics? If you aren't too familiar with
quantum mechanics, read the next paragraph, otherwise you can jump straight to
the quoted section.  
  
Take an electron and it will have some intrinsic spin that could be in two
possible states, either up or down. In quantum mechanics, after every
measurement it will be only one or the other. Before the measurement however,
it can be in any state that is a _superposition_ of up or down. In
mathematical notation, you can take your overall states
[math]|\psi\rangle[/math] and describe it like [math]|\psi\rangle = a|\uparrow
\rangle + b|\downarrow \rangle[/math], where the coefficients [math]a[/math]
and [math]b[/math] are complex numbers. They are called _probability
amplitudes_, and to get from these amplitudes to actual probabilities, you
need to take the modulus squared, i.e. [math]P_{|\uparrow\rangle} = |a|^2 =
aa^*[/math], where [math]P_k[/math] is the probability of being in the
[math]k[/math]th state and [math]s^*[/math] means the complex conjugate (that
is, if you had [math]s = x + iy[/math], then [math]s^* = x - iy[/math]). As in
normal probability, [math] |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1[/math].  
  
And now the answer to What is the relation between quantum computing and
quantum mechanics?  
  

> It's actually quite simple. The information for a qubit in some particle
will be its spin state. In quantum mechanics, spin is no different than
position, velocity, energy, etc. That is, you can't know what state it is in
exactly because it's in a superposition of states. It's related somewhat to
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Take a look at this graph:

In this diagram, we're using the z-axis as our measurement basis. So the
vector [math]\left|\psi\right\rangle[/math] has some polar angle
[math]\theta[/math], and its projection onto the z-axis is what we'll see
(since we'll be measuring according to the z-basis). But of course, as you can
see, it's not _fully_ in the zero or one state, it's partially in both. **When
you measure, though, it will pick one or the other.**

> So after going through all this trouble, we understand qubits a little bit.
The key reason why we like qubits better (in some cases) than classical bits
is clear when we look at a two-qubit system. Remember the notation we used
above.  
  
[math]|\psi\rangle = a|\uparrow\uparrow\rangle + b|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle +
c|\downarrow\uparrow\rangle + d|\downarrow\downarrow\rangle[/math]  
  
How did we get four possible states? The overall state can be in any possible
configuration (in fact, it _is_ in all these possible configurations, with
some probability). Another way to say this is that [math]|\psi\rangle[/math],
the state _vector_, lives in an [math]n[/math]-dimensional space. The state
vector tells you "how much" you are in a certain state. A simple way of
visualizing the state vector is given by the Bloch sphere, which is the image
I used above in the quoted section.  
  
With qubits, you have two possible states, so you can see that the number of
possible states with [math]k[/math] qubits gives you a state vector that lives
in a space with dimension [math]n = 2^k[/math]. And this is why qubits are so
powerful. Using entangled qubits allows us an exponentially large
computational space (Hilbert space) to represent and manipulate information.
[*]  
  
How exactly to use that space to do things is not easy to understand, and
unfortunately I don't know of any algorithms that are clear enough to explain
to the layman. Personally, I have to think pretty hard about quantum
algorithms. If I can come up with anything, I will add it to this post.
Alternatively, if anyone else has ideas, please feel free to suggest in the
comments or edit this section.  
  
[*] Now this is not "wrong" to say to an introductory person in quantum
information, but it's still a bit of an open question whether entanglement is
the whole story for quantum speedup. There are some models, like the one-
clean-qubit model, that only require one pure-state qubit and a host of other
qubits that are _not_ entangled. It is not a universal quantum computer, but
it is believed to be more powerful than classical computers.

**Classical bit **is a variable that holds value from {0, 1}.   
**Qubit** is a variable holding superposition of clear states   
(clear states [math] |0&gt;, |1&gt;[/math] correspond to 0,1 respectively)  
qb =  [math]a |0&gt; \+ b |1&gt;[/math] for complex a,b such that  
[math]|a|^{2}[/math]  +  [math]|b|^{2} = 1[/math]  
(If you don't get |x&gt; notation, go look up Dirac/bra-ket notation).  
  
But what does this superposition mean? It means that if you measure qb in
standard basis  
([math]{|0&gt;, |1&gt;}[/math])  
you will get  
[math]|0&gt;[/math], or  [math]|1&gt;[/math] with probability
[math]|a|^2[/math] and  [math]|b|^{2}[/math] respectively.  
  
So, in a way, qubit holds much more information (in a classical sense) than
classical bit - it can be in any of states that correspond to two complex
numbers which squared magnitudes sum to one.  
The problem is, there is no simple way of extracting that information, but why
is that so probably belongs to another question (this is what quantum
computing is about).

A Quantum Bit or a Qubit, is the smallest unit of quantum information,
analogous to the bit, in classical computers.  
  
A qubit will have 2 states, that represent its 2 different configurations.  
For a classical bit, information is the bit being in either one of those
configurations. But a qubit is in a superposition of both states and hence can
take all values in between.  
  
Say 0 and 1 are the 2 states, then  
S = a1 |0&gt; \+ a2 |1&gt; , where S is the state of the qubit and summation
of |an| squared equals 1.  
For a classical system, S =0 OR 1.
