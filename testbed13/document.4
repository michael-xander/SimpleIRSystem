What's This?

By Adario Strange2013-10-13 15:54:33 UTC

Although we’ll have to wait to discover what innovations Google’s secret “X
lab” holds for the future, the company does have at least one bleeding-edge
venture it wants to unveil to the public right now. In partnership with NASA,
Google has embarked on a project to use a 512-qubit D-Wave Two quantum
computer to tackle some of our biggest computational problems.

And because visuals often help explain complex concepts, Google has posted a
short documentary explaining what quantum computing is, and how it plans to
use the technology to make new discoveries.

First announced back in May, Google’s partnership with NASA will allow the two
teams — along with several universities — to share the powerful computer, so
they can research several different areas.

Traditional digital computing – which drives the computer you’re using now —
operates using a binary approach, which on a basic level refers to
differentiating bits of data in their 1 and 0 states from one another.

Quantum computing differs from digital computing in that it gives researchers
the power to put bits of data into their 0 and 1 states simultaneously, rather
than cycling through calculations in a linear fashion as is common with
traditional digital computers. The potential applications for quantum
computing could advance our understanding of weather patterns, theoretical
physics and even artificial intelligence.

This new computing dynamic not only gives scientists the ability to determine
a variety of possible solutions simultaneously, but it also saves energy and
speeds up the computing process by many orders of magnitude.

For Google in particular, quantum computing could help it make advances in
search, neural networking and artificial intelligence. These advances will
ultimately help the company achieve its goal of being able to tell you what
you want before you even ask it.

Of course, this very general description of quantum computing is still bit too
much for some of us — still making our way through the tangle of traditional
computing — to fully grasp. That’s why Google’s new video is a welcome primer
on the topic, offering a set of very simple and entertaining explanations on
the technology.

While the NASA partnership presents exciting possibilities for harnessing the
new technology, Google has been looking at quantum computing for some time. As
early as 2009, Google discussed its research work with quantum-computing
company D-Wave, which was related to studying machine-learning with quantum
algorithms.

At the time, Google’s Hartmut Neven wrote, “Over the past three years, a team
at Google has studied how problems such as recognizing an object in an image
or learning to make an optimal decision based on example data can be made
amenable to solution by quantum algorithms … These algorithms promise to find
higher-quality solutions for optimization problems than obtainable with
classical solvers.”

The field of quantum computing is still so new that even researchers aren’t
exactly sure of what they’ll learn over the next few years; it's what makes
the project even more exciting.

Posting a message to Google+, the Google Quantum A.I. Lab team wrote, “We’re
still in the early, early days, but we think quantum computing can help solve
some of the world’s most challenging computer-science problems.

"We’re particularly interested in how quantum computing can advance machine
learning, which can then be applied to virtually any field: from finding the
cure for a disease to understanding changes in our climate.”

**BONUS: 10 Great Behind-the-Scenes Glimpses of Google**

# 10 Great Behind-the-Scenes Glimpses of Google

  1. ## 1\. Life at the Googleplex

This official Google vid offers a tour of Google HQ (a.k.a. the "Googleplex")
in 200 seconds. Most interesting snippet of info? There are more than 200 dogs
on campus on any given day. Woof!

  2. ## 2\. Google - Best Place to Work 2007

Offering a behind-the-scenes glimpse into Google from an NBC news report's
perspective, this clip was shot just after Google had been named America's
best place to work by Fortune back in 2007.

  3. ## 3\. Google's New Zurich office

Google's Zurich office is up there as one of the top premises in terms of
wackiness. Here, _Web User Magazine_ has a little nose around -- be sure to
keep watching to the end for a quick look at the old fashioned library room.

  4. ## 4\. Inside Google's New York Office

The New York offices look just as sweet as Google's Silicon Valley
headquarters. The building in the Big Apple has the second largest footprint
of any NYC structure -- so big that the Googlers get round on scooters,
leaving them in special scooter "parking bays." Watch out for the LEGO wall
and really cool floor map.

  5. ## 5\. Inside Google Australia

There aren't a lot of revelations in this Aussie clip (the usual colorful
offices, look at all the food and oooh, there's a ping pong table) but it goes
some way to show that Google manages to keep its wacky office set up even
7,000 miles around the globe.

  6. ## 6\. Google Office - Madison, WI

While it's hardly Google's most famous office, the Madison, Wisconsin location
adds a good dose of the usual Google zaniness and manages to incorporate some
of the building's history into its decor -- truly a unique workspace for all
those lucky Googlers.

  7. ## 7\. Google Chicago Headquarters Tour

WGN News gets a tour of Google's premises in the windy city where we find out
just how those "Recent Searches" displays in Google's lobbies remain so smut-
free.

  8. ## 8\. Google's Chicago Games Room

And -- as we didn't see this in the previous tour -- here's a look at the cool
game room within the Chicago complex. It's like your dream lounge, but with
more geeks.

  9. ## 9\. Google in St. Petersburg 

An insider look at a Google office in Russia transcends any language barriers,
although what's with all the soft toys?

  10. ## 10\. Google Container Data Center Tour

Google isn't just about the colorful offices and crazy fun. It's also about
the million or so servers that keep us Googling. Here Google opens the door to
a data center in a somewhat dry video that will no doubt be fascinating to
anyone in the industry!
