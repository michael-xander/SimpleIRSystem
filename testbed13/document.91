# End of slow PCs? IBM creates super-fast quantum computer which brings AI
closer

### ENGINEERS have created lightning-quick quantum computers which will be
freely available to everyone to use online.

GETTY

IBM has made a quantum computer available to everyone

IBM's new technology also means breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI)
are one step closer.

The lightning-fast computers allow for multiple questions to be answered at
once at a rapid pace, as opposed to standard computers which work through
answers sequentially.

While a standard computer uses "bits" to process problems and information,
quantum computers use "qubits" which can store and process multiple bits of
information at the same time.

Experts believe they will be beneficial to the scientific community in many
aspects, but predominantly in artificial intelligence (AI), where new forms
will be able to be created due to quantum computing's abilities in deciphering
problems.

IBM Quantum Computing Scientist Jay Gambetta uses a tablet to interact with
IBM Quantum Experience

IBM's quantum computer, located at its New York laboratory, will be connected
to the internet and made accessible to the public via the Cloud.

Arvind Krishna, senior vice president and director of IBM Research, said:
"Quantum computers are very different from today's computers, not only in what
they look like and are made of, but more importantly in what they can do.

GETTY

Quantum Computers could lead to advancements in AI

"Quantum computing is becoming a reality and it will extend computation far
beyond what is imaginable with today's computers.

"This moment represents the birth of quantum cloud computing."

IBM is making the quantum computer which has a five-quoit processor, available
freely to everyone so that people, mainly scientists, can figure out ways to
use it in their research field.

Mr Krishna continued: "By giving hands-on access to IBM's experimental quantum
systems, the IBM Quantum Experience will make it easier for researchers and
the scientific community to accelerate innovations in the quantum field, and
help discover new applications for this technology."
