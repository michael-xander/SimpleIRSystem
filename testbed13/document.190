# Gold stabilises in European trade

April 26, 2016

RECORDER REPORT

0 Comments

Gold steadied on Monday as a retreat in the dollar helped to arrest the
previous session's 1.3 percent slide, but moves were muted ahead of a Federal
Reserve policy meeting this week. The Fed is not expected to raise interest
rates at this week's meeting, but markets will be looking for the US central
bank's take on the global economy and its monetary policy outlook.  
  
Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of
holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar, in
which it is priced. Spot gold was at $1,232.50 an ounce at 01146 GMT, little
changed from late on Friday, while US gold futures for June delivery were up
$4.70 an ounce at $1,234.70.  
  
Prices have risen more than 16 percent this year as expectations for a Fed
rate hike faded, the dollar softened and investors showed renewed interest in
commodities. Their gains have slackened in recent weeks, however. "There are
two general themes that are lifting gold as well as other commodities - the
weaker dollar, which probably has a bit further to run, and renewed enthusiasm
for China," said Dan Smith, senior analyst at Oxford Economics. "The danger is
that this is moving to a bubble in some areas."  
  
The dollar fell 0.3 percent against a currency basket on Monday, while oil
prices dipped as traders took profits after three weeks of gains and European
shares slid ahead of central bank meetings in the United States and Japan.
Economists expect the Fed to deliver a rate increase in June and follow up
with another by the end of the year. But interest rate futures show less
conviction, underscoring the wide gap between markets and policymakers on the
path of rates.  
  
"The direction taken by the gold price in the short term is likely to depend
on the (Fed)," Commerzbank said in a note. "If it raises the prospect of
another rate hike in the near future at its meeting on Wednesday, this is
initially likely to weigh on the gold price." Speculators continue to bet on
rising gold prices. Data on Friday showed that hedge funds and money managers
raised their bullish positions in COMEX gold contracts to the highest in 3-1/2
years. Among other precious metals, silver, which touched an 11-month high as
it rallied 4.5 percent last week, was down 0.4 percent at $16.88 an ounce.
Platinum fell by 0.6 percent to $1,000.45 and palladium was flat at $600.33.
