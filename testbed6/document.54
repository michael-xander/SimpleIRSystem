           Which hashing algorithm is best for uniqueness and speed? Example (good) uses include hash dictionaries.  
           I know there are things like SHA-256 and such, but these algorithms are designed to be secure, which usually means they are slower than algorithms that are less unique. I want a hash algorithm designed to be fast, yet remain fairly unique to avoid collisions.

               @Orbling, for implementation of a hash dictionary. So collisions should be kept to a minimal, but it has no security purpose at all. –&nbsp;

               You're wrong; crypto algorithms are designed to be as fast as possible while still remaining secure. –&nbsp;

               Great post! Could you also check's Yann Collet's xxHash (creator or LZ4), which is twice as fast as Murmur? Homepage: code.google.com/p/xxhash More info: fastcompression.blogspot.fr/2012/04/… –&nbsp;

               @zvrba Depends on the algorithm. bcrypt is designed to be slow. –&nbsp;

           I tested some different algorithms, measuring speed and number of collisions. 
           I used three different key sets: 
            A list of 216,553 English words (in lowercase) 
            The numbers "1" to "216553" (think ZIP codes, and how a poor hash took down msn.com) 
            216,553 "random" (i.e. type 4 uuid) GUIDs 
           For each corpus, the number of collisions and the average time spent hashing was recorded. 
           I tested: 
            DJB2 
            DJB2a (variant using xor rather than +) 
            FNV-1 (32-bit) 
            FNV-1a (32-bit) 
            SDBM 
            CRC32 
            Murmur2 (32-bit) 
            SuperFastHash 
           Results 
           Each result contains the average hash time, and the number of collisions

           Notes: 
            The LoseLose algorithm (where hash = hash+character) is truly awful. Everything collides into the same 1,375 buckets 
            SuperFastHash is fast, with things looking pretty scattered; by my goodness the number collisions. I'm hoping the guy who ported it got something wrong; it's pretty bad 
            CRC32 is pretty good. Slower, and a 1k lookup table 
           Do collisions actually happen? 
           Yes. I started writing my test program to see if hash collisions actually happen - and are not just a theoretical construct. They do indeed happen:

           The other subjective measure is how randomly distributed the hashes are. Mapping the resulting HashTables shows how evenly the data is distributed. All the hash functions show good distribution when mapping the table linearly: 
           Or as a Hilbert Map (XKCD is always relevant): 
           Except when hashing number strings ("1", "2", ..., "216553") (for example, zip codes), where patterns begin to emerge in most of the hashing algorithms: 
           SDBM: 
           DJB2a: 
           FNV-1:
