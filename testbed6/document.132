           What is a data structure? What are the types of data structures?Data structures are used to store data in a computer in an organized fashion. Different types of data structures are:-
           Stack- Works in first in last out order. The element inserted first in stack is removed last.
           Queue- First in First out order. The element inserted first is removed first.
           Linked list- Stored data in a linear fashion.
           Trees- Stores data in a non linear fashion with one root node and sub nodes.
           What is a data structure? What are the types of data structures?The scheme of organizing related information is known as ‘data structure’. 
           The types of data structure are:
           Lists: A group of similar items with connectivity to the previous or/and next data items.
           Arrays: A set of homogeneous values
           Records: A set of fields, where each field consists of data belongs to one data type.
           Trees: A data structure where the data is organized in a hierarchical structure. This type of data structure follows the sorted order of insertion, deletion and modification of data items.
           Tables: Data is persisted in the form of rows and columns. These are similar to records, where the result or manipulation of data is reflected for the whole table.

          data structure 
           Data structure refers to an arrangement of data.
          Each data related in the memory

          Unique Data Structures 
           Alongside the ones listed here, there are several unique data structures worth checking out. I've implemented a few over here: www.devanpatel.me/implementing-unique-data-structures-in-c/

          data structure 
           Stack- Works in LIST IN FIRST OUT order. The element inserted first in stack is removed last.
          it is also called LIFO types of list.
