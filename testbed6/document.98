      In Topological Sort an ordering of the vertices in a directed acyclic graph, such that if there is a path from u to v, then v appears after u in the ordering. Could you please explain topological sort and its complexity ?

       Topological sorting is useful for defining the order things must be done. DAG (directed acyclic graph) can model the problem and the DFS can produce a sort that defines one valid ordering of paths to follow. 
       Lets take look at this example below:

       Speaking in general,a valid sequences of task is known as topological sorting. 
       It is a term in computer science used for referring to the ordering of vertices linearly from u to v, written as uv which is directed in a graph. Vertices of graph depicts the task that needs to be performed and edges depicts the constraints over that task. Topological sorting is applicable only for directed acyclic graph. While performing topological sort, temporary stack is used. 
       For one graph, there could be more than one topological sort. One mandatory condition every topological sort need to follow, the first vertex in every topological sort is always a vertex which has no incoming edges. 
       Example 1: 
       Here the topological sort will “5 4 2 3 1 0" or “4 5 2 3 1 0". 
       Example 2: 
       After topological sorting, it would be 
       When we talk about topological application, it is specifically used for scheduling jobs, logic synthesis, data serialization, resolving symbol dependencies in linker.
